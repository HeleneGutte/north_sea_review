A hand-gathering Cockle fishery has been in existence for many years at Traeth Lafan, a large sandy area in north Wales designated as a Special Protection Area on account of the wintering population of Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus. In addition to the hand fisher) suction-dredging for Cockles took place in four winters between 1989/1990 and 1996/1997 and the amount of farmed Mussels increased dramatically from 1995/1996 onwards. Since 1980/1981, the fishery can be characterised into three periods of similar management: 1980/1981 to 1988/1989, 1991/1992 and 1992/1993 (period A, eleven winters, hand gathering Cockles only, low Mussel stocks), 1989/1990 to 1990/1991 and 1993/1994 (period B, three winters, suction dredging and hand gathering of Cockles, low Mussel stocks) and 1994/1995 to 2002/2003 (period C, suction dredging in one out of nine winters and high Mussel stocks). Adult Oystercatcher survival, juvenile recruitment and both adult and juvenile mass were lower in period B, the winters in which dredging occurred and Mussel stocks were low. Increases in bird numbers after the dredging periods were due to greater juvenile recruitment, most likely caused by adults moving from the Cockle beds to feed on the new Mussel resource provided by a large increase in commercial farming. Commercial dredging for shellfish, even on a small scale, will increase the risk of higher Oystercatcher mortality especially if alternative food sources are not available. Mussel culture in the intertidal area adds new food supplies but internationally important numbers of birds should not have to rely on a food source of which the availability is likely to be determined by market forces.;0.053;Atkinson P.W., Clark N.A., Dodd S.G., Moss D.;"British Trust for Ornithology, The Nunnery, Thetford, Norfolk IP24 2PU, United Kingdom; Wittan Acre, Bringsty, Worcestershire WR6 5UJ, United Kingdom; 21 Stapleford Road, Oakham, Rutland LE15 7HF, United Kingdom";Changes in fisheries practices and Oystercatcher survival, recruitment and body mass in a marginal Cockle fishery;Small hand-gathering shellfisheries have not been associated with the major negative ecological impacts observed as a result of large-scale and long-term mechanical dredging of Mussel Mytilus edulis and Cockles Cerastoderma edule in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea and the Wash Estuary in the UK.

Full-scale, high-resolution measurements of the seabed and the scour protection around the monopile foundations in Horns Rev offshore wind farm are analysed and presented. The measured developments in the scour protection are related to wave and current conditions. The wind turbines at Horns Rev wind farm are each placed on circular monopiles at water depths ranging from 6-13 m at MSL. The seabed consists of fine to coarse sand (D50 = 0.15-1 mm). The wave conditions are severe - the largest waves are in the order of 8 m high. The max current in the wind farm area is approximately 0.88 m/s (50 year return period). The stability of the seabed around the wind turbine foundations is one of the major challenges in offshore wind farm design. Each foundation at Horns Rev is protected by a 50 cm thick filter layer (D50 = 10 cm) and a 1 m thick armour layer (D50 = 40 cm) placed within a radius of 9.5 m from the centre of the monopole. 5 high-resolution surveys of the scour protection around all the wind turbine units have been carried out before and after installation of the turbine foundations. The paper presents the development of the surrounding seabed and the scour protection themselves. The surveys around all 80 wind turbines consistently show a lowering of the scour protection and a net transport away from the scour protection area. The measurements also show that up to 1.5 m local lowering of the armour layer have taken place during the time period from 2002 to 2005. The largest lowerings have occurred close to the wind turbines. The history of the wave current climate in the wind farm area has been established from a combination of numerical simulations and measurements. From the wave current climate the movement of the underlying sand bed has been assessed. Simple flow analysis and the surveys indicate that the sand has been transported upwards through the filter and armour layers at most of the wind turbine locations. This has resulted in subsidence of the filter and armour layers into the sand bed. The top level of the scour protection layer is, however, still above the surrounding seabed level, which the wind turbines have been designed for. It is further concluded that some erosion up to 0.5 m (0.1 tower diameter) deep has occurred outside the scour protection in the distance 15 m away from centre of the wind turbines on the east side of the turbines (opposite the main wave direction (coming from)).;0.985;Hansen E.A., Simonsen H.J., Nielsen A.W., Høgedal M., Pedersen J.;"DHI Water, Environment, Health, Denmark; Vestas Wind Systems, Denmark; DONG Energy, Denmark";Scour protection around offshore wind turbine foundations, full-scale measurements;The major challenge of ensuring the stability of the seabed around offshore wind turbine foundations is addressed in the present paper.

UCG in deep coal seams has the advantages of reduced environmental impact and high pressure for gas processing. Recent UK studies into the feasibility of UCG have shown that UCG in combination with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potential future technology for the exploitation of UK coal resources. The environmental concerns about UCG arise from the escape of gas and dispersal of pollutants from underground cavities. Recent trials in Europe have shown that deep coal seams can be accessed and controlled through new technologies developed in the oil and gas industry. Directional drilling in coal, controllable injection through coiled tubing and high temperature well completions each contribute to the successful construction and operation of process wells in deep coal seams. Operating techniques are available to minimise pollutant escape into the surrounding strata. Product gases from the UCG of deep coal reach the surface at high pressure. As a result, smaller and less costly plant can clean the gases and remove particulate s. The separation, capture and transmission of CO2 to storage is also easier from a high pressure gas. Expansion of the gases in a Rankine turbine can provide additional internal power for the oxygen separation plant. The prime target for UCG-CCS in the UK would be the vast coal resources beneath the estuaries and near offshore areas of the North Sea. Secondary areas might include onshore coal resources but much of the unmined coal lies deep in rural areas where planning and environmental approval will be more problematical. Offshore oil and gas platforms are already in some of the preferred areas with pipelines to shore. Therefore, it is potentially attractive to consider the feasibility of an offshore UCG operation in shallow waters close to shore.

The rate of erosion will depend on the residual strength of the plasticized zone and of the hydrodynamic forces acting on that particular zone.

This national breeding bird register aims to monitor national population size and trends in e.g. Special Protection Areas of the EU-Bird Directive and is part of an ecological monitoring programme of the Dutch government. Fieldwork is carried out mainly by dedicated volunteers, co-ordinated by Sovon Vogelonderzoek Nederland and carried out according to standardised methods. Species covered are all colonially breeding birds (e.g. Great Cormorant, herons, gulls, Sand Martin and Rook) and all scarce to rare breeding birds, like Great Bittern, Western Marsh Harrier, Corncrake, Common Ringed Plover, Barn Owl, Whinchat, Common Raven and Corn Bunting. This paper summarises results of the surveys in 2000-2002, published before in annual reports (van Dijk et al. 2002, 2003). Population size estimates and an indication for trends are provided in Table 1. Note that numbers in many species (especially rare species) refer to territories, and do not necessarily include confirmed breeding. All three seasons covered here were preceded by exceptionally mild winters. Surveys in 2001 were seriously affected by Foot and Mouth-disease: especially in March-May several areas had restricted access or no access at all. Red-necked- and Black-necked Grebe were thriving. Settlement of several pairs of Red-necked Grebes in the northern part of the country probably expresses expansion of this species in nearby breeding centres in northern Germany. Great Cormorant generally remains stable in inland colonies, but continues to increase in the Wadden Sea. Due to the series of mild winters, populations of herons did well, with up to 300 breeding pairs (bp) of Great Bittern in 2002. Eurasian Spoonbill reached record population levels in 2002 (1500 bp) and has expanded to the German and Danish Wadden Sea. The Mediterranean 'flavour' of some regions was also enhanced by good numbers of Little Egret (37 bp in 2002) and Great White Egret (47 bp in 2002), which now have a major core breeding area in the Delta area and Oostvaardersplassen in Flevoland, respectively. Rapidly expanding species are also found among geese. Especially Greater Canada Goose and Barnacle Goose show exponential population growth. The population of Barnacle Goose already consists of 2000-2500 bp. Recovery of Red-crested Pochard, starting after major improvement in local water quality, continued. For Common Eider, a species which is notoriously difficult to monitor, the population trend is less obvious. In areas where numbers are well-known recent data point at a decline. Among raptors, Peregrine Falcon is still expanding: 13 bp were counted in 2002. Remarkable were a nest of a Black Kite in 2000 (third for The Netherlands, but failed) and nest-building by a pair of Ospreys in 2002 (first attempt). The latter occurred too late in season to be fruitful, but coincides with an increase of summer visitors and observations of displaying birds. It is expected that the species will settle as a breeding bird in the near future. A worrying decline proceeds in Hen Harrier, which still has its stronghold on the Wadden Sea islands and joins Short-eared Owl in a downward trend. Corncrakes had an exceptionally good season in 2000 (540-585 territories) and moderate numbers in the following years. In 2001, the first breeding attempt of Common Crane was documented (in 2002 already two pairs bred). Some waders showed ongoing long-term declines (e.g. Kentish Plover, Ruff). Ruff mainly survives in special reserves and has abandoned nearly the entire country. Recent developments include declines in Pied Avocet populations along the mainland Wadden Sea coasts (20% decline since the early 1990s, probably mainly due to increased predation rates). Common Ringed Plover remained stable after a series of years with lower numbers. Mediterranean Gull, which increased in the 1990s, had a sudden breakdown, but this was only due to the move of important colonies in the SW-Netherlands across the Belgian border. Further declines were observed in Black-headed Gull and European Herring Gull. Black-headed Gulls have abandoned many inland colonies, whereas coastal colonies increasingly move to the Wadden Sea islands to escape predation from Red Foxes. A new breeding bird species was Black-legged Kittiwake, which first bred in 2000 on a platform on the Dutch continental shelf in the North Sea. Slightly expanding is also Greater Black-backed Gull. Tern populations generally remained stable but reproduction was poor in several colonies. Black Tern increased slightly. Barn Owl has nearly re covered from the population low in the 1960s and 1970s. However, numbers vary from region to region due to vole population cycles. Eurasian Eagle Owl, whcih first appeared in the southernmost edge of the country, occupied a new breeding site near the German border in Gelderland in 2002 and now counts three bp. Similar to herons (and species like Grey Wagtail), Common Kingfisher benefited from the series of mild winters. Stimulated locally by the restoration of natural river banks and improved water quality, the species reached unprecedented numbers (650-700 bp). In 2001 and 2002, a few European Bee-eaters bred, most of which failed. Eurasian Wryneck still balances on the verge of extinction in many areas; the national population only holds 65 bp at maximum. The same applies to Crested Lark, remaining in only few urban areas by now. Tawny Pipit shares the downward trend and might disappear soon as a breeding bird in the Netherlands (five territories in 2002, at least threee of which occupied by unpaired males). Again as a result of mild winters, population of Zitting Cisticola thrived in the southwestern part of the country. In another southern 'invader', Melodious Warbler, expansion proceeds slower than expected. Large fluctuations were observed in Bearded Reedling. Both Red-backed Shrike and Great Grey Shrike suffered losses; the latter species is expected to disappear as a breeding bird soon (no confirmed breeding, only two records in May-June). The long-term population recovery of Rook now seems to level off (see also Limosa 77: 11-24). Raven recently tends to decline, partly due to less favourable feeding conditions as supplemental feeding in the core breeding has stopped. Common Rosefinch has nearly vanished after an upsurge in the 1990s. The long-term decline in Ortolan Bunting is nearly completed; despite a few scattered singing (but probably unpaired) males, breeding was suspected only once.";0.445;van Dijk A.-J., Hustings F., Koffijberg K., van der Weide M., Deuzeman S., Dijksen L., Zoetebier D., Plate C.;"Sovon Vogelonderzoek Nederland, Rijksstraatweg 178, 6573 DG Beek-Ubbergen, Netherlands; Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, Postbus 4000, 2270 JM Voorburg, Netherlands";Rare and colonial breeding birds in The Netherlands in 2000-2002 [Kolonievogels en zeldzame broedvogels in Nederland in 2000-02];"In the Netherlands, national country-wide surveys of rare and colonial breeding birds have been carried out annually since 1992.

Remarkable were a nest of a Black Kite in 2000 (third for The Netherlands, but failed) and nest-building by a pair of Ospreys in 2002 (first attempt). The latter occurred too late in season to be fruitful, but coincides with an increase of summer visitors and observations of displaying birds. It is expected that the species will settle as a breeding bird in the near future. A worrying decline proceeds in Hen Harrier, which still has its stronghold on the Wadden Sea islands and joins Short-eared Owl in a downward trend. Corncrakes had an exceptionally good season in 2000 (540-585 territories) and moderate numbers in the following years. In 2001, the first breeding attempt of Common Crane was documented (in 2002 already two pairs bred). Some waders showed ongoing long-term declines (e.g. Kentish Plover, Ruff). Ruff mainly survives in special reserves and has abandoned nearly the entire country. Recent developments include declines in Pied Avocet populations along the mainland Wadden Sea coasts (20% decline since the early 1990s, probably mainly due to increased predation rates). Common Ringed Plover remained stable after a series of years with lower numbers. Mediterranean Gull, which increased in the 1990s, had a sudden breakdown, but this was only due to the move of important colonies in the SW-Netherlands across the Belgian border. Further declines were observed in Black-headed Gull and European Herring Gull. Black-headed Gulls have abandoned many inland colonies, whereas coastal colonies increasingly move to the Wadden Sea islands to escape predation from Red Foxes. A new breeding bird species was Black-legged Kittiwake, which first bred in 2000 on a platform on the Dutch continental shelf in the North Sea. Slightly expanding is also Greater Black-backed Gull. Tern populations generally remained stable but reproduction was poor in several colonies. Black Tern increased slightly. Barn Owl has nearly re covered from the population low in the 1960s and 1970s. However, numbers vary from region to region due to vole population cycles. Eurasian Eagle Owl, whcih first appeared in the southernmost edge of the country, occupied a new breeding site near the German border in Gelderland in 2002 and now counts three bp. Similar to herons (and species like Grey Wagtail), Common Kingfisher benefited from the series of mild winters. Stimulated locally by the restoration of natural river banks and improved water quality, the species reached unprecedented numbers (650-700 bp). In 2001 and 2002, a few European Bee-eaters bred, most of which failed. Eurasian Wryneck still balances on the verge of extinction in many areas; the national population only holds 65 bp at maximum. The same applies to Crested Lark, remaining in only few urban areas by now. Tawny Pipit shares the downward trend and might disappear soon as a breeding bird in the Netherlands (five territories in 2002, at least threee of which occupied by unpaired males). Again as a result of mild winters, population of Zitting Cisticola thrived in the southwestern part of the country. In another southern 'invader', Melodious Warbler, expansion proceeds slower than expected. Large fluctuations were observed in Bearded Reedling. Both Red-backed Shrike and Great Grey Shrike suffered losses; the latter species is expected to disappear as a breeding bird soon (no confirmed breeding, only two records in May-June). The long-term population recovery of Rook now seems to level off (see also Limosa 77: 11-24). Raven recently tends to decline, partly due to less favourable feeding conditions as supplemental feeding in the core breeding has stopped. Common Rosefinch has nearly vanished after an upsurge in the 1990s. The long-term decline in Ortolan Bunting is nearly completed; despite a few scattered singing (but probably unpaired) males, breeding was suspected only once.";2005;Article;Limosa;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26444584506&partnerID=40&md5=c23a6ae76aa619cdea657a24390e0fc2;Scopus;csv;3525;0.8333333333333334;5032;True;#NV

The gulls turned out to Black-legged Kittiwakes, a cliff-nesting seabird that had never bred in The Netherlands before. A visit by Wintershall staff in 2001 confirmed the presence of at least 3 nests. L8-P is an uninhabited gas-exploitation p latform at 53°38.5′N, 04°34′E, in 32 m deep water, an area known as the Frisian Front (a separation zone between turbid water of the Southern Bight and clear, saline water of the Central North Sea). No information was received since then and a visit planned for 2004 had to be cancelled. On 22 June 2005, however, a full day was spent on the island and a colony census could be conducted successfully. On eight different locations, with most nests (62.2%) along the east and southeast side of the platform (Fig. 1), 45 apparently occupied nests were found. Of these, 22 nests were empty, eight contained a single egg, and 15 held two eggs. The mean egg size was 55.84 × 39.98 mm, with no difference between single egg and double egg clutches. Samples of guano and nest material were taken, and these suggested that the birds fed mainly on small sandeels Ammodytes spp. and Sprat Sprattus sprattus (calculated fish length 5-15 cm: Table 2). The nests were built of a mixture of natural materials (seaweeds such as Fucus vesiculosus, Euteromorpha spp., Flustra foliacea, and Ascophyllum nodosum) and all kinds of plastics and nylon. Mean clutch size was low, perhaps typical for a newly established colony, but the prospects for this site seem promising, except for a limitation of nest sites. The food situation is likely to be excellent, as previous observations on seabirds in this part of the North Sea have shown. The results show that the birds focused on natural prey rather than on discard (in sharp contrast with the prey remains of large Larus gulls found on the helicopter deck of the same site. The few available data suggest exponential growth of the colony.

Both species, but partcularly Kentish Plover, have shown considerable declines in The Netherlands, especially in the Wadden Sea. In the breeding season of 1997, a study was carried out on factors that determine breeding success of Kentish and Ringed Plovers on the islands of Terschelling, Vlieland and Griend in the Dutch Wadden Sea. In total 33 Kentish Plover and 24 Ringed Plover nests were found. Hatching success was 30% and 36% respectively. Compared to data from other sites, these percentages are not extremely low. The main cause of nest loss was prédation, followed by flooding of nests. The first eggs were laid in late April and the last nests were started in late July. Breeding success amounted 0.25 and 0.40 fledglings per pair of Kentish Plovers on Terschelling and Griend respectively. Ringed Plovers raised 0.40 fledgling per pair on Terschelling and 0.67 on Griend. Considering that the reproduction necessary for a stable population amounts to 0.8 and 0.9 fledgling per pair per breeding season for Kentish and Ringed Plovers respectively, the observed breeding success is too low to compensate mortality. On the North Sea beach of Terschelling most chicks died shortly after hatching. The chicks that made it until fledging were all born on the south side of the island, adjacent to the mudflats. Growth rates of chicks that grew up on the south side of the island matched with measurements on growth rates of Kentish Plover chicks in Hungary. The growth of Ringed Plover chicks that were born on the North Sea beach and stayed alive showed retarded growth compared to chicks in England. On the Wadden Sea side, Ringed Plover chicks grew much faster. A combination of food availability and disturbance is the most likely cause for this reduced growth and low survival on the beach. Visitors on the beach probably prevent the families with chicks to exploit the best feeding areas close to the water and force them to stay on the higher drier areas close to the dunes with lower food availability. Apart from this, the presence of visitors reduces the amount of foraging time, since when the parents are alarming, the chicks refrain from feeding.

A description and analysis of governance of the Netherlands North Sea contributes to this debate for a number of reasons. Commercial demands on the North Sea are intense. Shipping routes are very busy. The Netherlands is a major producer of natural gas. Naval conflicts and disputes over fishing rights involving the Netherlands date back more than 400 years. The Netherlands is hemmed in by neighbouring countries on land and at sea, and the activities in the North Sea of one country in the region can have a significant impact on the ocean environment in the other countries. Furthermore, there are a number of countries in the catchment area of rivers flowing into the North Sea. There is a need to govern the pollution and alien biological organisms that these rivers carry into the ocean.;2003;Article;Geomatica;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242627456&partnerID=40&md5=e36682b737bd4b8dc093b880014c876e;Scopus;csv;4113;1.0;5620;True;#NV

While this is a highly positive trend, other forces are at work, which could counter, to some extent, this reduction in accidental pollution from shipping activities. Governments are increasingly aware that their territorial waters are home to many wrecks. A high proportion of those wrecks took their cargoes and bunkers with them to the seabed, and their deteriorating condition is a matter of concern. At some point in the future, the pollutants will be released into the marine environment as hulls continue to corrode. An elderly wreck can produce a slow leak, requiring a series of costly clean-up operations, or release hundreds of tonnes of oil or chemicals in a major failure of a weakened structure. Either way, the result is no different from a fresh shipping accident and spill. Heavy clean-up costs, disruption to the life of local communities and major claims for compensation. There are many thousands of elderly wrecks in coastal waters, particularly in northwest Europe and the eastern and western seaboards of the United States. Many of these wrecks are the remains of casualties from the two world wars. While there are fewer ship losses today, concern for the marine environment has reached new heights. There is a climate of zero tolerance of pollution damage. In Europe, incidents such as the Erika and the levoli Sun have further increased public awareness of the environmental consequences of ship losses and the dangers of repeated pollution caused by leakage from wrecks. In the past, wreck removal-or partial removal-has been performed to clear a berth of obstruction or to remove a hazard to safe navigation. More recently, there has been an increase in the number of wreck removals performed for environmental reasons. One option here is to remove the potential pollutants, rather than the wreck itself. This is a difficult issue. Pumping out wrecks can be hazardous for divers and it is costly when the wreck is deeper than 50 metres and requires saturation diving. This is the background to the development of SMIT's POLREC diverless system for removing pollutants from wrecks. POLREC is a fully automated system for the subsea pump-out of liquid pollutants from wrecks. It applies ""hot-tap"" technology, a system first developed in the chemicals industry for breaking into live lines. The system makes possible the pollution-free recovery of oils and chemicals, with zero risk to life and with a significant cost advantage over saturation diving. POLREC can be deployed for tasks far below the 50 metre zone and, in combination with an all-weather surface platform, it can work efficiently in areas prone to severe winter weather, such as the North Sea.";0.138;van Rooij H.;SMIT Salvage BV, Rotterdam, Netherlands;POLREC: A fully automated system for pollution removal: A diverless solution for the subsea pump-out of environmental threats from wrecks;"New regulatory initiatives, the mandatory introduction of formal safety management regimes and improved training, backed by port state inspection, has led to a significant decline in the number of serious casualties and spills at sea.

There is a climate of zero tolerance of pollution damage. In Europe, incidents such as the Erika and the levoli Sun have further increased public awareness of the environmental consequences of ship losses and the dangers of repeated pollution caused by leakage from wrecks. In the past, wreck removal-or partial removal-has been performed to clear a berth of obstruction or to remove a hazard to safe navigation. More recently, there has been an increase in the number of wreck removals performed for environmental reasons. One option here is to remove the potential pollutants, rather than the wreck itself. This is a difficult issue. Pumping out wrecks can be hazardous for divers and it is costly when the wreck is deeper than 50 metres and requires saturation diving. This is the background to the development of SMIT's POLREC diverless system for removing pollutants from wrecks. POLREC is a fully automated system for the subsea pump-out of liquid pollutants from wrecks. It applies ""hot-tap"" technology, a system first developed in the chemicals industry for breaking into live lines. The system makes possible the pollution-free recovery of oils and chemicals, with zero risk to life and with a significant cost advantage over saturation diving. POLREC can be deployed for tasks far below the 50 metre zone and, in combination with an all-weather surface platform, it can work efficiently in areas prone to severe winter weather, such as the North Sea.";2003;Article;Sea Technology;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037282116&partnerID=40&md5=8203fc911c7c8844bcfe71bf3ee5fc17;Scopus;csv;4201;1.0;5708;True;#NV

ACTA;"Baeyens, W.; Gillain, G.; Decadt, G.; Elskens, I.";Advanced analysis procedures for dissolved and particulate trace metals in sea water have been developed and tested in international intercalibration exercises. Since these tests gave evidence that reliable data could be produced with such methods, trace metal distributions in the coastal waters of the eastern North Sea were studied. The spatial distributions of most dissolved and particulate trace metals are, at least qualitatively, similar. Their concentrations decrease with distance from the coast and the mouth of the Scheldt estuary (particulates much stronger than dissolved species). The salinity gradient is similar (but opposite) to the trace metals and turbidity gradients. The five trace metals studied can be subdivided into two groups on the basis of their K(D) ratios (particulate metal concentration to dissolved metal concentration). Hg and Pb are strongly associated with particulate matter (K(D) from 0.5 to 1.5 offshore and from 7.9 to 40 in the coastal area), while Cd, Cu and Zn are predominantly in the dissolved phase (K(D) from 0.1 to 0.2 offshore - up to 0.5 for Zn - and from 1 to 1.7 in the coastal area). The distribution of the metal concentrations in suspended solids (mg.kg-1) are much more complex. Only the Pb distribution is similar to that of the turbidity, but also to those of the major inorganic elements in suspended sediments (Al, Fe, Mn) and the chlorophyll a content. However, the chlorophyll a content is, like the salinity, inversely correlated to the concentrations of the major inorganic elements. High X/Al (X = Cd, Cu, Hg, or Zn) ratios in suspended matter are observed at low suspended matter concentrations. Detrital organic matter is probably the main carrier of these trace metals. At high suspended matter concentrations, these ratios decrease and approach the reference soil value. Both the Scheldt estuary and resuspended bottom sediments may be the source of those high suspended matter concentrations. Fe/Al and Mn/Al ratios are high at high suspended matter concentrations and decrease at low turbidity. These particles enriched in Fe and Mn are supplied by the Scheldt estuary.

Therefore, an airborne coastal patrol with the objective of identifying oil spills reliably must comprise additional sensors.;1986;Conference Paper;Digest - International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS);#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023012492&partnerID=40&md5=e7d0a9f7db6059761acbac6a74952939;Scopus;csv;418;1.0;1925;True;#NV

Until the mid eighties, at least three night roosts were present around the feeding areas, but afterwards these locations were abandoned, due to habitat changes and disturbance (Fig. 1). The last 15 years only the Balgzand reserve in the western Wadden Sea area was used as a regular night roost.

Black Terns were counted weekly in the evening in 15-minute periods simultaneously with the counts near Balgzand (Vatrop) until 1 September (Fig. 2). Up to 15 000 Black Terns used the roost at Enkhuizen and in total 38 000 Black Terns were present on 18 August on both ternaries.

The edible part of all fishes was investigated for the content of total-mercury, lead and cadmium by means of AAS. A selected number of 10 herrings was additionally examined for the content of the three metals in liver and kidney. The content of organochlorine pesticides and PCB's was determined in 10 samples by means of gas-liquid-chromatography on a fused-silica-capillary-column.

Within a comprehensive study for the evaluation of offshore wind farms bird calls were registered automatically on a research platform in the south-eastern North Sea. The species identification of nocturnally migrating birds is almost exclusively possible only by means of their calls. Here, we present species-specific bird occurrence near an anthropogenic offshore structure in the total daily and yearly course on the basis of automatically registered calls. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 100 species was identified. Calls from 95,318 individuals (excluding the large gulls) were used for analyses. Three quarters were passerines (predominantly thrushes), furthermore mainly waders, terns and smaller gulls were detected. 79.4% of all individuals were registered during the night. High numbers of individuals, mostly of several species occurring together, were concentrated in only a few days/nights or even hours. Bird occurrence was much higher during autumn migration than during spring migration. A maximum of 5,236 birds of different species (corresponding to 392 Ind./h) was identified in the night from 28th to 29th October 2005. The migration periods of the short-/medium distance migrants were clearly distinguishable, otherwise not those of the long-distance passerine migrants, presumably due to their much minor ambition to call. In July mainly smaller gulls and terns, in August above all terns and waders (especially Redshank) and in winter some late smaller gulls and thrushes were registered. Generally, numbers increased continually with the beginning of the night and reached a maximum before sunrise. The fewest birds were detected in the late afternoon. Despite methodological constraints, the shown species-specific phenologies broadly match the migration times in the offshore area of the German Bight as recovered by trapping and/or by scheduled or coincidental visual observations of bird migration. Like these methods the acoustic recording cannot cover the whole occurrence of birds. Presumably, the number of birds is underestimated during fine and overestimated during adverse weather when birds reduce flight altitude. However, we assume that the birds registered acoustically on the platform reflect at least the low flying proportion of the calling species in the course of the year and in their daily variability. The opportunity to estimate numbers of low and thereby close to an anthropogenic obstruction flying birds using calls is - with regard to the evaluation of its collision risk and the introduction of mitigation and avoidance measures (site, short-term shutdown of the construction and optimization of illumination) - not exiguous. © DO-G, IfV, MPG 2012.;0.852;Hüppop K., Dierschke J., Hill R., Hüppop O.;"Institut für Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, An der Vogelwarte 21, D-26386 Wilhelmshaven, Germany; Avitec Research GbR, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Germany";Annual and diurnal phenology of birdcall activity above the German Bight [Jahres- und tageszeitliche phänologie der vogelrufaktivität über der Deutschen Bucht];With regard to potential sites for the construction of offshore wind farms and to their possible threats for birds it is essential to enlarge the current knowledge on bird migration above the sea - especially during the night.

The first concerns the significant increase in the tidal range and high water level within the past 40 years. The second is the predicted increase in the rate of mean sea level rise as a result of expected climate changes. The investigations show that a mean sea level rise will result in significant changes in the tidal dynamics (tidal range, flow velocities and tidally-induced residual currents), in the German Bight and the Elbe Estuary especially close to the coastline. For example, the tidal range at some coastal gauges will increase by more than 30% of the mean sea level rise. A greater increase can be expected in the Elbe Estuary. The inter-tidal areas are an important component of coastal protection. In order to estimate their future influence on the tidal dynamics, computations were done considering a possible increase of the inter-tidal area associated with an increased mean sea level. The calculations of the influence of a mean sea level rise on the behaviour of storm surges are restricted to historical events.

Because of the many permanently changing processes which govern nutrient concentrations, an exact interpretation of the results is difficult. Impact on nutrient situation is given mainly by input from land runoff and rivers, by import from other sea regions, by atmospheric input, by horizontal and vertical mixing of imported substances, by incorporation into living organisms, as well as by the release from biological material. In spite of the most complex nutrient situation the presented data demonstrate the anthropogenic burden on the German Bight in a high degree. In early summer nearly all nitrate and phosphate would be used up by phytoplankton under natural conditions. But nutrients are supplied continuously by river input. On their way into the German Bight they are distributed within the area of the plume of riverine water coming from the rivers Elbe and Weser. Here they are taken up by phytoplankton as long as phosphate is available. This results in water bodies with a high surplus of nitrogen and little growth of phytoplankton, since phosphate is missing then. In many parts of the German Bight phosphate concentrations are below the detection limit in early summer, in spite of the high anthropogenic input. In the area of the fresh water plume the ratio of nitrogen containing nutrients to phosphate can reach a maximum of 3000:1 instead of 15:1, which would be found under natural conditions. The drastic shifting of nutrient ratios is man made and supposed to result in an increase of toxic algal blooms and in a change of the natural phytoplankton species composition of the German Bight. In consequence significant changes of the existing ecosystem are to be suspected. At areas where water bodies rich in nitrate and poor in phosphate get mixed with phosphate containing water bodies, rapid growth of algal blooms is possible. Onset and localities of such events are not predictable, as long as the meteorological and hydrographic conditions as well as the chemical situation are not known exactly. But this would require permanent and high activities of several research vessels in summer half-year. Nevertheless it would hardly be predictable which of the many different phytoplankton species would bloom.

Based on this analysis ICES has proposed spatial and temporal restrictions for the fishery in each Natura 2000 site of the German Exclusive Economic Zone. Implementation of these measures within the Natura 2000 sites can ensure the conservation of protected habitats and species in future. In the context of the reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy it is hugely important to make use of the new legal frameworks such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in order to bring about a sustainable future for nature and fisheries.;2011;Article;Natur und Landschaft;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880094068&partnerID=40&md5=6a2b1d668d1aaedcfbe9dbe6858cb279;Scopus;csv;5038;0.824390243902439;6545;True;#NV

Aquatic species arrive through a variety of mechanisms-unintentionally when attached to vessel hulls or carried in vessel ballast water and intentionally when imported for aquaria display, as live seafood for human consumption, or as a transplant to increase sport fishing opportunities. The arrival of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes and their subsequent damage to city water supplies and electric utilities has focused significant attention on ballast water discharge by cargo ships as a high-risk mechanism for species invasion. New management efforts attempt to address this concern. Congress is considering legislative proposals to amend and reauthorize the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, including specific provisions that would modify how ballast water is managed. In late August 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard published proposed regulations to establish quantitative standards for ballast water treatment. The proposed standards would initially follow standards developed by the International Maritime Organization. In a subsequent phase, the quantitative standards would become much more stringent, given sufficient technological development to support achievement of the higher standards. The proposed Coast Guard standards would not preempt existing state ballast water management standards. This chapter provides background on various approaches to ballast water management and reviews current ballast water management laws and programs. With increases in the number of people traveling, the speed and methods of travel, the types and volume of trade, the ability to move living plants and animals so that more of them survive the journey, and the different modes of transport for hitch-hiking organisms, invasive species have become a global concern. Although there are many ways in which species may invade,1 this chapter focuses on ballast water discharge by cargo ships as one of the more significant mechanisms for biotic invasion of coastal and estuarine habitats as well as inland navigable waters. The arrival of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes in the late 1980s and their subsequent damage to city water supplies and electric utilities2 focused initial attention on ballast water as a source of invasive species. Reflecting the scope of the problem, the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem is considered to be one of the most disrupted aquatic ecosystems in the United States, with colonization by more than 230 non-native species.3 Compounding the problem, species that invaded via other mechanisms (e.g., mitten crabs that are believed to have been an illegal seafood introduction) may be further spread through ballast water transport and vice versa (e.g., zebra mussels are spreading to new drainages via boats transported on trailers). In the Gulf of Mexico, ballast water has been implicated in the contamination of commercial oyster beds.4 Globally, it is estimated that more than 10,000 marine species each day may be transported across the oceans in the ballast water of cargo ships.5 The ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was transported in ballast water from estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America to the Black Sea, where it is blamed for a massive collapse of the commercial fish harvest. Around 1978, the American jackknife clam, Ensis directus, was introduced through ballast water in the German Bight and has spread rapidly over the North Sea coast, where it has become one of the most common bivalves, replacing many native species. The economic, social, recreational, and ecological losses/costs attributable to aquatic invasive species are difficult to quantify. While some costs have been estimated, such as the $5 billion in damages to water pipes, boat hulls, and other hard surfaces by zebra mussels in the Great Lakes,6 others, such as the losses of native species and environment restoration to pre-invasion quality, are unknown.

When one forager found prey, even distant Gannets responded by joining the finder to obtain a share of the bounty but, because of the low densities of Gannets far from the colony, feeding opportunities were typically exploited by small flocks, with relatively few competing birds. Intraspecific competition was thus less intense than it would have been nearer the colony. Searching and feeding tactics of Gannets, as well as foraging associations with other top predators, were different between sea areas. Low numbers of Gannets per flock occurred within inshore multi-species feeding associations, where Gannets hampered feeding opportunities for other seabirds (and themselves) by plunge-diving into compact schools of small prey fish. Larger flocks of competing Gannets formed in situations where an escape response in prey fish was absent (discards behind commercial trawlers) or weakened (fish schools herded by marine mammals). The association of Gannets with marine mammals was typically an offshore phenomenon, despite the abundance of cetaceans in inshore waters. Behind trawlers, Gannets focused mostly on roundfish, between 22 and 30 cm in length. Discards were, however, a fairly unimportant source of food during the breeding season and natural feeding opportunities were widespread. © British Birds 104 · February 2011.;0.971;Camphuysen K.;Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ), PO Box 59, 1790 AB Den Burg, Texel, Netherlands;Northern gannets in the North Sea: Foraging distribution and feeding techniques around the Bass Rock;Field observations around the largest Northern Gannet Moms bassanus colony in the North Sea, the Bass Rock, showed that 66% of all Gannets foraged in areas with very low densities of conspecifics, more than 100 km from the colony. When one forager found prey, even distant Gannets responded by joining the finder to obtain a share of the bounty but, because of the low densities of Gannets far from the colony, feeding opportunities were typically exploited by small flocks, with relatively few competing birds. Intraspecific competition was thus less intense than it would have been nearer the colony. Searching and feeding tactics of Gannets, as well as foraging associations with other top predators, were different between sea areas.

While the shipping of liquids in bulk is still largely dominated by oil, the percentage of chemicals is sharply rising in certain regions of the world, such as the English Channel through which 30 million tonnes were transported a year in 1988, compared to 150 million tonnes a year in 2000 (HASREP, 2005). This increase in maritime traffic induces an increase in the risk of accidents and, consequently, an increased risk of spills of cargo at sea (collision, grounding, etc.). Furthermore, the wide diversification of the chemical nature of products transported, their highly varied physico-chemical properties that generated very different behaviours at sea, their potentially hazardous nature both for humans and for the ecosystem as a whole, constitute a set of factors that significantly complicate the operational response strategy to be defined in the case of a spill. So as to better identify the risks which certain chemicals transported by sea may present, the notion of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) emerged in Europe in 2000. Depending on the substances concerned, location and characteristics of the incident, response can therefore range from the ""leave alone"" option, as in the case of the Maltese chemical tanker Balu which sank in the Bay of Biscay in 2001, releasing her 8,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, to the deployment of major on-land and at-sea response means, as in the case of the chemical tanker Ievoli Sun which sank in the Channel in 2000, for which response operations included both response at sea (treating the cargo) and monitoring of potential pollution on the shoreline (sampling of coastal waters and air quality measurements). Several international, regional and national authorities, aware of the risk connected with the transport of chemicals by sea, have published operational guides to describe the possible response options. For instance, IMO has published several manuals (IMO, 1987, 1992), REMPEC has done the same for the Mediterranean (REMPEC, 1996, 1999, 2004); we can also mention the Helsinki Baltic Sea Convention manuals (HELCOM, 1991, 2002, 2007), the North Sea Bonn Agreement manuals (Bonn Agreement, 1985, 1994) as well as on a national level in France the Cedre response guides each of which is specifically dedicated to a given chemical. Alongside this information, which ranges from is general (i.e. the case of a guide on response at sea to hazardous substances), or specific (i.e. guides that characterize the behaviour and identify the risks related to a given product), the Standard European Behaviour Classification system or SEBC code determines the short-term behaviour of any chemical as long as its physico-chemical characteristics are known. This tool is of the utmost importance for operational staff in charge of response, as it can be used in an emergency to indicate the main components of the ecosystem that will be affected. However, experience has made clear that this code can be tricky to use as it can be difficult to understand how the environmental factors (wind, sunshine, water and air temperature, etc.) will affect the categorization of the chemicals. Indeed these parameters have a very significant influence on the short-term fate of chemicals in the marine environment, in particular on their evaporation kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the atmosphere), their dissolution kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the water column) and their transport and transformation processes in the aqueous phase.";0.011000000000000001;Le Floch S., Fuhrer M., Merlin F., Aprin L., Slangen P., Mouries M., Laflamme A.;"Cedre, Brest, France; Ecole des Mines d'Alès, Alès, France; Nymphéa Environnement, Cassis, France; Transport Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada";Fate of a xylene slick at sea and influence of meteorological conditions;"Shipping is a valuable solution for transporting large quantities of non-perishable goods over long distances.

However, experience has made clear that this code can be tricky to use as it can be difficult to understand how the environmental factors (wind, sunshine, water and air temperature, etc.) will affect the categorization of the chemicals. Indeed these parameters have a very significant influence on the short-term fate of chemicals in the marine environment, in particular on their evaporation kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the atmosphere), their dissolution kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the water column) and their transport and transformation processes in the aqueous phase.";2010;Conference Paper;Proceedings of the 33rd AMOP Technical Seminar on Environmental Contamination and Response;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955596358&partnerID=40&md5=32950eda51b0e0a4a6455b3f7a48f23e;Scopus;csv;5365;1.0;6872;True;#NV

With ""seawatching"" the migration of mostly larger species (waterbirds in the broadest sense) over the sea was recorded and ""islandwatching"" concentrated on the migration of smaller species (mostly passerines) over land (islands in this case). The particular goal of this study is the synoptic observation at three locations at least during the migration periods. Apart from some exceptions, at all three sites seawatching showed the highest migration intensity in the morning hours, much less migration occurred at midday and in the evening. Varying proportions of species are mainly caused by the different breeding and staging/wintering areas, whereby the three sites are touched by the birds to a greater or lesser extent. This phenomenon is most obvious in geese. With seawatching in the first three hours after sunrise a total of 185 species was recorded (154 near Sylt, 137 near Helgoland and 148 near Wangerooge). For 23 species, which were abundant or are regarded to be critical concerning effects of offshore wind turbines, the seasonal and daily patterns of migration intensity are described and shown in graphs, diurnal variation of migration intensity for 15 species and flock size for 11 species. In many species, migration was more intense near Sylt in autumn and near Wangerooge in spring, whereas a more balanced relation of the two migration periods was typical for Helgoland. During both seasons the daily migration intensity of the three sites was highly significantly correlated. That holds true for the overall picture of all species as well as for the migration intensities of many particular species. Due to the geographical locations of the breeding and wintering areas of most species, a general direction of migration along a SW-NE-axis can be expected. However, the results of seawatching could prove this only for Helgoland. Near Sylt and Wangerooge, most birds followed the coastline, i.e. they migrated along a S-N-axis and W-E-axis, respectively. With islandwatching in the first three hours after sunrise a total of 189 species was observed (165 above Sylt, 133 above Helgoland and 161 above Wangerooge). Phenology are described and presented graphically for 23 relatively abundant species, flock size for 10 species. As with seawatching, migration intensity was lower at Helgoland than at the two coastal islands and showed roughly the same amount of birds during spring and autumn migration. As a consequence of the preference of most passerines to migrate along a leading line, migration was stronger for many species in autumn at Sylt and more pronounced in spring at Wangerooge: While relatively few birds headed towards the sea at Sylt (autumn) and Wangerooge (spring), the great majority of birds followed the coastline southward (Sylt in autumn) and eastward (Wangerooge in spring), respectively. Obviously, passerines avoided to fly towards the open sea during daytime and followed the coastline instead. Hence, the few birds arriving from sea produced low migration intensities at Sylt in spring and at Wangerooge in autumn. The SW-NE-direction predominating in bird migration in Central Europe was only approved at Helgoland. But even there, jetties of the harbour acted as leading lines, because in autumn many passerines left the island towards SE and S. Because of the leading line effects at Wangerooge (spring) and Sylt (autumn) the connection was strongest between the sites representing migration over sea, i.e. between Helgoland and arrivals above Sylt in spring, but between Helgoland and arrivals above Wangerooge in autumn.

According to its own internal whistleblowers, the International Energy Agency appears to have falsified information on world fossil fuel depletion-- on the grounds that telling the truth that world energy resources may already have peaked in production and are exceeded by demand, could cause skyrocketing oil prices and stampede the world into a new recession. Depletion of finite resources such as oil, gas, useable water or minerals is likely to impact on world GDP well before the worst impacts of global warming. The two together are likely to constrain world food production seriously, particularly in countries with high population densities or insufficient fertile lands. Food security in these countries is behind the huge ""land and water grab"" by foreign nationals that is now occurring across the developing world. Worldwide, governments have dealt with the recession by increasing consumption to prevent job losses which has increased demand for scarce resources, in order to return countries to growth (or business as normal). If peak oil has already arrived or is imminent, providing public funds to already damaged businesses that have large carbon footprints, is clearly irrational. Historically, global economic growth has never occurred without a simultaneous increase in the use of fossil fuel energy; GDP growth and world oil production growth have tracked each other for decades. It seems that while the IEA expects a steady increase in available oil, recent, more believable, evaluations of the decline in oil from the major giant oil fields that are already in the phase of depletion (e.g. Cantarell in Mexico and the North Sea province etc) suggests that Peak Oil arrived in 2008 and that by 2030 the production from fields currently on stream could have decreased by over 50 per cent (Hook 2009).The probable effect will be high prices flowing on into every walk of life, especially the cost of food with its huge embedded fossil fuel energy costs. This will inevitably increase financial instability and produce more recessions. Although global warming is probably the greatest problem humanity has ever faced the most immediate issue is the finite nature of fossil fuel that has supported the presently high standard of living (in industrialized countries). Without cheap oil there is no cheap food. There is no cheap water, health care, travel, housing or recreation. Without cheap energy the world contracts to using local resources and local activities. As food availability and diversity declines, it may lead to a decrease in the human population. This is contrary to the forecasted increase from 6.7 to over 8 billion people in the next 20 years. Human population increase is often considered the major problem that will impact on both resource depletion and global warming but consumerism by the wealthy is presently of major concern The carbon footprint of multi millionaires can be up to ten thousand times that of the average person in industrialised countries, which in turn is 10 times that of the average person in developing countries and many of the 1 billion subsistence farmers in the world have almost insignificant use of fossil energy. There are around 10 million people world wide with assets greater then a million dollars and therefore have disproportionate effect on world resource depletion and global warming. No politicians appear to be willing to address the problem of resource depletion and yet people are the end users and will be greatly affected as demand exceeds production for many resources, from rare earth metals through to energy and water. Politicians and business entrepreneurs appear to be willing to ignore the dangerous outlook for future generations, being only concerned with their present wealth, health and living standards and no politician wants to be the one telling their electorate that The free market economy and globalization must be severely constrained. Living standards or expectations of, in particular the rich, must be reduced-consume less, shop less, live in smaller homes, grow food locally, recreate locally and give up extravagant travel modes and also non essential travel and so on More and more people will have to cross the line from simply exercising brain power to make a living, to exercising imaginative and also efficient use of muscle power from animals and themselves to generate food. For the sake of peace and equity it will also be essential to lift the standard of living of the poor and mandate birth control in all countries if the floods of refugees that could occur through resource depletion and global warming, are to be prevented. Cuts in their use of fossil fuels should be forced first on the super rich who should pay a high price to pollute the global atmosphere at the cost of burning of fossil fuels (e.g. flying or owning private jets, large ocean cruisers, multiple cars and mansions and so on) However it is essential that everybody, above a minimum standard of living, must make some sacrifice. Few of us are going to do it voluntarily as it means giving up too much of our lifestyles for it to be effective in curbing greenhouse gases to a 'safe' level. The world needs time to adjust to even the first decade of the second half of the age of oil The objectives of governments should be to reduce fossil fuel exploitation and use it efficiently so as to maintain world reserves as high as possible to allow a slow reduction in populations and a narrowing of the resource use by rich and poor countries as society comes into equilibrium with resource availabilities. Traditional forms of economic growth will be impossible in a resource-depleted world. We need new forms of growth based upon intellect and human talent and skill rather than raw materials. Before any meaningful change of attitudes can take place, society has to understand that oil is truly finite - and is going to become very scarce sooner rather than later. Secondly the true cost of the conspicuous and wanton consumption of this fossil fuel energy must be identified and acknowledged and appropriate depletion strategies implemented.

These mass-mortalities could be linked to severe food short-ages. Eiders swallow their prey whole and need shellfish with a favourable shell: flesh ratio, i.e. with thin shells and high flesh content. It turns out that Mussels Mytilus edulis from the sublittoral zone have the most favourable ratio. When such Mussels are in short supply, the probability of mass-mortality among Common Eiders increases (Fig. 3), especially when there is also a shortage of alternative food stocks, namely the Cut Through Shell Spisula subtruncata, which occurs in the coastal zone of the North Sea. In the winter of 2005/06 stocks of sublittoral Mussels were again very low and stocks of the Cut Through Shell were negligible. Yet, mortality among Common Eiders was not exceptional. One reason that few Eiders died was that the wintering number was exceptionally low (Fig. 4). In 1993-2005 aerial midwinter counts fluctuated between 91 000 and 168 000 with an average of about 120 000. In the winter of 2006/06 only 82000 ducks were counted. Another reason for the low mortality is that many Eiders apparently fed on the American Razor Clam Ensis directus. Since the disappearance of the Cut Through Shell, this species has become the most numerous shell-fish in the North Sea coastal zone. It is conceivable that this species can only profitably be harvested by the ducks when they are not above a certain size, but very little is actually known. Although mechanized fishing for Cockles Cerastoderma edule in the Dutch Wadden Sea was stopped in January 2005, this offers no guarantee against future mass-mortalities of Common Eiders. Eiders regularly feed on Cockles, but there is as yet no evidence that Cockles, which mainly occur in the littoral zone, are important as an alternative food source when sublittoral Mussels are scarce.

Two different emission scenarios, A2 and B2 (characterized in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios, SRES), which were projected onto European climate conditions by different global and regional climate models, are considered. An increase of the annual maximum water level in St. Pauli of about 20 cm appears possible and plausible for the time horizon of 2030. In 2085, the mean scenario for St. Pauli amounts to an increase of 64 cm. These calculations employ a mean sea level rise of 9 cm (2030) and of 29 and 33 cm (2085), respectively.

Two different emission scenarios, A2 and B2 (characterized in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios, SRES), which were projected onto European climate conditions by different global and regional climate models, are considered. An increase of the annual maximum water level in St. Pauli of about 20 cm appears possible and plausible for the time horizon of 2030. In 2085, the mean scenario for St. Pauli amounts to an increase of 64 cm. These calculations employ a mean sea level rise of 9 cm (2030) and of 29 and 33 cm (2085), respectively.

These UAV are of the B-Hunter type. They have been commissioned in 2000 by the Belgian Army for the purpose of military intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance missions. They are fitted with a dual sensor gyrostabilized turret combining a daylight camera and a thermal infrared camera allowing for day and night observations. Live images of the sensors are transmitted in real time to the ground control station. The use of the B-Hunters for the detection of marine pollution finds its origin in a decision taken in 2003 by the Belgian Federal government aiming at an optimization of the operational resources for detecting illicit discharges by vessels and collecting evidence for prosecuting offenders. To that end, the Belgian authorities have developed a concept of marine environmental surveillance based on the combined use of four different surveillance platforms: remote sensing aircraft, helicopter, satellite and UAV. This concept is now fully implemented. The operations of all Belgian marine pollution surveillance platforms are coordinated from the Maritime Security Center (MIK) of the Belgian Coastguard structure where all relevant data are centralized and dispatched to the competent authorities for information and further action. The surveillance aircraft is used for routine patrol flights above the southern part of the North Sea. The satellite surveillance service provides for information in near real time about possible oil spills and other anomalies at the sea surface. Stand-by helicopters are used for rapid assessment of reported spills and sampling. The main advantages of the B-Hunter system are its long flight endurance of about 10 hours and the fact that it is undetectable thanks to its small size and low noise signature. The B-Hunter system offers additional possibilities for routine surveillance such as the continuous monitoring of a specific area (anchorage, shipping lane) or the tracking of a suspect vessel. The B-Hunters are also expected to play a useful role in case of a major accidental spill for the monitoring in real time of the progress of the response operations and for providing information for guiding the pollution combating vessels.

Degradation of pesticides to lesser toxic compounds by various mechanisms in marine organisms is therefore important to the survival of marine animals. Experiments were carried out on the metabolism and some aspects of accumulation of DDT 14C at very low concentrations in the marine polychaetes Lanice conchilega and Nereis diversicolor and in the flatfishes Platichthys flesus and Solea solea, which feed partly on these polychaetes. The animals in these experiments are part of the bottom fauna of the Weser River and the coastal area of the North Sea. The possibility of accumulating DDT from very low environmental concentrations by marine polychaetes seems to be an important factor for the introduction of DDT and presumably other persistent pesticides into the marine food chain, e.g. polychaetes to flatfishes. The absorbed DDT is metabolized in both polychaetes and flatfishes only after longer periods of exposure or higher doses. Accumulation data from these experiments are preliminary for the polychaetes because of the short experimental period and the lack of constant DDT concentrations in most cases. But it is clear that very low concentrations of 0.01 ppb led to a level of about 2 ppb in the Lanice conchilega within a short time. The concentration in water is calculated from the applied dose and the volume of water. Since some DDT absorbs to the glass walls of the tanks, the true concentration in water is lower than this.

Part 5: Ringing recoveries from 1909 to 2008;Vogelwarte;"Hüppop, K.; Hüppop, O.";"The collection of ringing recoveries of birds caught on the isolated North Sea island of Helgoland covers an extraordinarily long period and, except of the war years, includes only little interruption. Since 1909, the ringing station ""Vogelwarte Helgoland"" has accumulated data of more than 11,100 birds that were ringed on Helgoland and recovered abroad. The present analysis comprises all of these recoveries, as well as information on birds ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland. A total of 6,914 recoveries of birds ringed on Helgoland derive from 108 species; 134 species ringed on Helgoland yielded no recoveries. About 18% of all recoveries originate from the period between 1909 and the end of the Second World War. Between 1959 and 1985, the average number of recoveries reached 134 per year. Thereafter, numbers declined to an average of 82 recoveries per year. For almost all species, we provide the recovery rate, largest distance of recovery site, maximal daily flight distance, and highest age. Data of 116 individuals showing an exceptional recovery site, age at recovery, migration speed or circumstance of recovery are presented separately. Recoveries stemmed from 41 countries, covering a range from Spitsbergen to Namibia and from Iceland to the Ural. Most birds were recovered in Germany, followed by France, Great Britain, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Norway. Several recoveries were reported from Africa but only few from the eastern European states and from Asia. From all recoveries of birds ringed on Helgoland, the Blackbird Turdus merula and the Song Thrush Turdus philomelos were the most frequent, with more than 1,000 individuals each. The Guillemot Uria aalge was the third most frequent species to be recovered (more than 500 recoveries). For another 11 species, there were more than 100 recoveries each. Several individuals ringed on Helgoland were reported more than once from abroad. To the North, most recoveries occurred within a maximum range of around 600 km, with concentrations at 70 to 80 km near the western coast of Schleswig-Holstein and at 420 to 600 km in southern Scandinavia. Only a few recoveries were reported from further than 2,000 km in northerly directions. Towards the South, the majority of recoveries were reported from distances of up to 2,300 km, with concentrations occurring at 40 to 80 km, 400 to 500 km, 1,000 to 1,300 km, and 2,000 to 2,300 km. Only a few southern recoveries came from distances greater than 3,000 km. Judging from the recovery locations, migration was directed to the North East in spring and to the South West in autumn.Estimated average migration speeds of birds ringed on Helgoland varied strongly, depending on the number of days that had elapsed between ringing and recovery. Within short/medium-distance and long-distance migrants, standardized migration speeds did not differ significantly between spring and autumn. However, average autumn migration speed was generally higher in long-distance than in short/medium-distance migrants. The overall recovery rate was 0.91 % (pooled across all birds ringed on Helgoland). The recovery rate of non-passerines (5.65 %) was significantly higher than that of the passerines (0.67%). Thrushes (Turdus spec.) showed a significantly higher recovery rate (0.94%) than all other passerine species (0.48%). Before the Second World War, recovery rates of birds in general, and at the species level in particular, were to some extent higher than after the end of the war, but significantly only for thrushes. Most recoveries were retrieved under unknown circumstances or had been shot, while far less individuals were recovered through capture. With less than 10% each, the proportion of birds recovered under natural circumstances, observed alive in the field or detected as casualties of human activity was comparatively low. Most birds were recovered dead, less than one quarter of all recovered birds was alive, while for less than 10% condition at recovery was unknown. Circumstances of recovery as well as condition at recovery changed significantly during the 20th century due to a noticeable drop in hunting activity. A total of 1,516 reports of birds ringed abroad and recovered between 1909 and 2008 on Helgoland comprised 96 species. With 275 recoveries, the Blackbird was the most frequently recovered species, followed by the Herring Gull Larus argentatus (197 recoveries) and the Great Black-backed Gull Larus marinus (86 recoveries). Before 1960, the number of occasional recoveries from abroad was insignificant; thereafter recoveries averaged around 28 per year. For the majority of species that were ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland, we provide the maximum distance to ringing origin, maximum daily flight distance and maximum age at recovery. Data on 54 recovered birds originating from unusual ringing localities or suggesting an exceptionally old age are presented individually. Birds ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland originated from 950 ringing localities and 22 countries. Most individuals had been ringed on the British Isles, followed by Norway and Germany. Only a few recoveries stemmed from Eastern Europe, and none were recovered from Africa or from Asia. By far the most frequent recoveries from abroad were re-traps, followed by shot individuals and re-sightings. Two thirds of all birds ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland were found alive. Recoveries of Guillemots bred on Helgoland are dealt with separately. This species showed the third highest number of recoveries (653 individuals, most of them recovered in Scandinavia) and a relatively high recovery rate of 7.6 %. Most Guillemots had been shot (mainly in Norway), were found oiled (predominantly along the shipping routes of the southern North Sea) or were retrieved through fishing activity (mainly in Sweden and Denmark). © DO-G, IfV, MPG 2009.";0.845;Hüppop K., Hüppop O.;Institut für Vogelforschung Vogelwarte Helgoland, Inselstation, Postfach 1220, D-27494 Helgoland, Germany;An atlas of bird ringing at the island of Helgoland.

With 275 recoveries, the Blackbird was the most frequently recovered species, followed by the Herring Gull Larus argentatus (197 recoveries) and the Great Black-backed Gull Larus marinus (86 recoveries). Before 1960, the number of occasional recoveries from abroad was insignificant; thereafter recoveries averaged around 28 per year. For the majority of species that were ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland, we provide the maximum distance to ringing origin, maximum daily flight distance and maximum age at recovery. Data on 54 recovered birds originating from unusual ringing localities or suggesting an exceptionally old age are presented individually. Birds ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland originated from 950 ringing localities and 22 countries. Most individuals had been ringed on the British Isles, followed by Norway and Germany. Only a few recoveries stemmed from Eastern Europe, and none were recovered from Africa or from Asia. By far the most frequent recoveries from abroad were re-traps, followed by shot individuals and re-sightings. Two thirds of all birds ringed abroad and recovered on Helgoland were found alive. Recoveries of Guillemots bred on Helgoland are dealt with separately. This species showed the third highest number of recoveries (653 individuals, most of them recovered in Scandinavia) and a relatively high recovery rate of 7.6 %. Most Guillemots had been shot (mainly in Norway), were found oiled (predominantly along the shipping routes of the southern North Sea) or were retrieved through fishing activity (mainly in Sweden and Denmark). © DO-G, IfV, MPG 2009.";2009;Article;Vogelwarte;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70349560430&partnerID=40&md5=96cda12f8744182bd776bbd5a2fcaf38;Scopus;csv;5702;0.8524904214559387;7209;True;#NV

For analysing recorded water levels at tide gauge sites, a suitable and homogeneous time series is required. Before one can analyze the available data sets, they have to be checked and if necessary adjusted to observed changes in the tide gauge location to avoid misinterpretation. Especially detailed information about the elevation of tide gauge sites is important because they are influenced by tectonic movements and anthropogenic effects. In this paper the focus is on the influence of the subsidence at the lighthouse of Cuxhaven on the MSL water level time series of the tide gauge of Cuxhaven Steubenhöft in the second half of the 19th Century. The tide gauge Cuxhaven Steubenhöft provides the longest and uninterrupted digital time series in the German North Sea (since 1843, restricted to the tidal high (HW) and low water levels (LW)). Thus, this water level time series forms the essential basis for conclusions on historical water level developments on both regional (German North Sea) and global scales. Therefore, the comparability of results from different studies can only be given, if uniform data sets are used. To analyze the influence of subsidence at the lighthouse of Cuxhaven on the MSL water level time series, 18 tide gauge sites were used. The criterion was a data availability that reaches back to the middle of the 19th century. A correction of the raw data as suggested by SIEFERT and LASSEN (1985) was applied to the water level time series of Cuxhaven Steubenhöft in the period of 1855 to 1900. Subsequently, visual, trend and correlation analysis were performed. The comparison with the other tide gauge locations revealed that a correction of the time series is not necessary.

The oil spill transport model has been calibrated and validated with 18 drifter buoys deployed in the study area as a part of the project.

The optimal values of the parameters were found to be CC = 1.14 and CD = 0.00015. The high CC value obtained (close to 1) indicates a good agreement between the drifter-derived current field and the radar HF current measurements and represents an improvement with respect to similar studies performed using numerical currents data. The small value obtained for CD could be related to the low-profile drifter design, aimed at minimising wind effect.

Res.;"Caramanna, G.; Hennige, S.";Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel sources, transport and store it in suitable geological formations where it will be confined for extremely prolonged times. This is considered a feasible way of mitigating global warming. The seafloor is one of the target areas to safely store large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 through the development of sub-seabed CO2 geological storage. For the UK and large parts of Europe, the North Sea is potentially the most suitable location for CCS projects required to achieve planned targets in the reduction of CO2 emission. Other sub-seabed areas are studied for their storage potential in America and Asia. Even if the technology is considered proven, following the experience gained from the oil industry in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a few CO2 storage pilot projects, the risk of CO2 seepage must be addressed considering potential consequences on the marine environment. CO2 emissions may affect the seafloor with physical (e.g. sediments displacement), chemical (e.g. acidification) and biological (e.g. toxicity) effects. Laboratory experiments and the study of natural submarine CO2 vents are contributing to the development of a solid body of knowledge on these effects. The research is largely multidisciplinary, requiring expertise in natural sciences, engineering, chemistry and physics. The main observed consequences of CO2 emissions are a quick and strong acidification of the environment which may lead to the mobilization of pollutants, such as heavy metals, within the sedimentary cover of the seafloor diffusing within the overlying water column. Increased weathering of calcareous substrata is also likely following exposure to CO2- enriched fluids. Potential impacts upon local biodiversity would include displaced dissolved oxygen leading to anoxic regions, and localised ocean acidification. Consequences of increased CO2 would be a reduction in local seawater pH, and in the availability of carbonate ions required by calcifying organisms to grow. Predicted CO2 levels from potential seeps would lead to dissolution of exposed calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of local organisms. While some species would be able to tolerate and survive in such situations, others would die or suffer reduced growth rates. This is particularly pertinent for sessile benthic organisms which could not migrate following the onset of seepage. Naturally occurring submarine CO2 vents located along active tectonic and volcanic areas provide a good example of how organism communities change depending on their proximity to released CO2. For example, coral survival and growth decreases the closer they are to the CO2 vents, with macroalgae dominating the habitat instead. The timing and duration of potential industrial CO2 seeps would preclude the possibility of organism genetic adaptation over successive generations, and as such, possible impacts would depend upon organism acclimation potential and resilience.

The data were derived from a national monitoring scheme for 17 colonial species and c. 100 scarce or rare breeding birds, carried out in The Netherlands since at least 1992. Fieldwork is conducted using standardized methods, among which a new software application for aggregating the daily records submitted by observers into territories (Autocluster). For some species the data represent complete national censuses, for others only key sites (including all Natura 2000 sites) are covered (see Tab. i).The counts are part of a governmental ecological monitoring network and are coordinated by Sovon Dutch Center for Field Ornithology, in close collaboration with Statistics Netherlands (cbs; trend analyses) and species' experts and working groups. Fieldwork is mainly conducted by dedicated volunteers and staff of nature conservation agencies. Counts in the Wadden Sea are part of the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (tmap). Table 1 summarises numbers and trends. The breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011 were preceded by winters with cold spells and extensive snow cover, particularly 2009/10. These and the previous rather cold winter of 2008/09 had a clear negative impact on numbers and distribution of some species, notably Little Egret (-77% from 2008 to 2010, but slight recovery in 2011), Grey Heron (-20%), Common Kingfisher (-50%), Zitting Cisticola (-50%) and Grey Wagtail (-50%). Contrary to expectation, populations of Eurasian Bittern, Barn Owl, Little Owl and Cetti's Warbler did not decline after these winters. Compared to previous reports, the expansion of thriving (or recovering) species like Little Bittern, Purple Heron, White Stork, Eurasian Spoonbill, White-tailed Eagle, Montagu's Harrier, Peregrine Falcon, Common Crane, Eurasian Eagle Owl, European Nightjar, Middle Spotted Woodpecker, Redbacked Shrike and Eurasian Treecreeper (subsp. macrodactyla) continued in 2010-11. Great White Egret, rapidly increasing in numbers in the non-breeding period, still shows little expansion as a breeding bird. Also the settlement of Boreal Owl in 2008-09 did not last; despite extensive nocturnal searches only solitary males were recorded. Further highlights in 2010-11 included breeding Whooper Swan (1 pair), Ferruginous Duck (3 in 2010), Smew (1-4, possibly escaped birds but no signs of captivity), Atlantic Great Cormorant P. c. carbo (5-6), Black Kite (1-2), Baillon's Crake (7-9), Black-legged Kittiwake (new settlement on a platform in the Dutch North Sea, where coverage incomplete), Little Gull (1), Eurasian Hoopoe (1 territory) and Citrine Wagtail (successful, male paired with Blue-headed Wagtail). Melodious Warbler still remains a rare breeder, confined to the southern fringes of the country. For the first time since years, a fairly complete census of Bearded Reedling resulted in a national population estimate of 1500-1700 pairs in 2010 (in 2011 declining to 800-1000). Compared to these increasing or accidental breeders, there is a wide range of species that have suffered declines in the past decade(s), and did not show any sign of recovery in 2010-11. Examples are Black Grouse (4 males in 2011), Hen Harrier (20-25 pairs), Pied Avocet, Kentish Plover, Black-headed Gull, Short-eared Owl and Eurasian Wryneck.

The decline of oil production after this peak, initiated the interest in carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery floods (CO2 EOR) in 1972 to help extend the production life of some fields. With some exceptions, (Turkey, Abu Dhabi, Brazil, China, Malaysia, and the North Sea) the use of CO2 for EOR has been minimal outside the US. The Permian Basin (PB) alone accounts for over 50% of CO2 EOR worldwide projects (Melzer, 2012). The PB encompasses over 300,000 acres of various reservoirs under CO2 EOR floods. Through 2014, current oil production is in excess of 190,000 BOPD which represents 65% of CO2 EOR production in the US. Production is projected to increase to 323,000 BOPD by 2020. Constant surveillance of the CO2 migration during flooding is critical so that the injection pattern can be modified to optimize oil sweeping efficiency. One common method for CO2 monitoring is wireline well logging. Open-hole (OH) logs are normally acquired and then interpreted to evaluate the fluid saturation of the three phases1 (oil, water and CO2). At times, due to operational conditions and efficiencies, OH logs are not available. This limits the capability for a reliable CO2 monitoring for the surveillance teams. Cased-hole logging (CH) offers an operational advantage as well as a base line log for Time-Lapse monitoring. Quantitative reservoir evaluation through casing has been accomplished for decades using a combination of neutron logging tools with different neutron sources and a variety of gamma-ray detector materials. The primary measurements of these tools are: Sigma (Σ), Thermal Neutron porosity (TPHI), Carbon-Oxygen ratio (C/O) and Gamma Ray Spectroscopy. A multimineral petrophysical analysis is then performed to provide quantitative volumetric results. One of the main challenges of this interpretation is the ability to differentiate gas filled porosity from very low porosity formations. Both measurements; Σ and TPHI respond similarly in these conditions. Unless porosity is known from other sources (i.e. OH logs), neither of these measurements alone can provide a reliable answer. A different petrophysical measurement would be desirable to allow for this differentiation. This paper shows the application of a new pulsed neutron wireline service that measures a new formation property, fast neutron cross section (FNXS). This measurement makes possible differentiating gas-filled porosity and low porosity formations. FNXS is sensitive to the formation’s atom density which is independent from Hydrogen Index and is sensitive to the gas-filled porosity. Other new features of the new tool is the ability to self-compensate for the influence of the borehole (like for instance gas filled boreholes) and the completion using a combination of near, far and deep detectors and various timing gates. These new measurement advancements allow the log analyst to solve the three phase problem via a multi-mineral solver when OH logs are not available. This paper shows three CO2 EOR case studies in the PB where CO2 has been quantified for identifying good versus poor sweep efficiencies. The analysis shown here, helped the operator to design and optimize their completion strategy as well as having better understanding of the reservoir behavior under CO2 flood.

The tendency of people worldwide to live or work near the seaside as well as tourism and industrial developments along the seashore, have exercised pressures on the marine environment. These include chemical pollution, loss of biodiversity, introduction of alien species, ecosystem degradation, loss of marine mammal population and beach erosion. Enrichment of the marine environment with nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, from agricultural activities, marine aquaculture, sewage effluents and airborne pollution, stimulates phytoplankton growth causing a number of problems known as ""eutrophication"". Eutrophication can affect fisheries and marine biodiversity; it can also lead to phytoplankton blooms sometimes with toxic phytoplanktonic species, algal scum, bacterial blooms, fungi developments, hypoxia and in extreme cases anoxia. Among the side effects of eutrophication, reduced transparency or even change of the sea color impairs the recreational value of coastal waters and it is therefore a serious problem that has economic consequences for coastal states. A number of regional treaties have already been enforced including the problem of eutrophication. The Barcelona Convention for the Mediterranean, the Bucharest Convention for the Black Sea, the HELCOM Convention for the Baltic and the OSPAR Convention for the North Sea are among the regional instruments implemented for a better governance of the marine environment. In this chapter the eutrophication status of the European Regional Seas is examined, the policies for mitigating eutrophication are reviewed and the effectiveness of the measures over the period of implementation is assessed. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

These assess-ments should also evaluate the effectiveness of measurestaken or planned for the protection of the marine environ-ment, and identify priorities for action (Article 6 of andAnnex IV to the OSPAR Convention).The 1992 Ministerial Meeting, at which the OSPARConvention was signed, also issued an action plan for theOSPAR Commission, with a commitment to prepare thefirst Quality Status Report for the whole North-East Atlanticby the year 2000 (the ‘QSR 2000’).To implement these commitments the OSPARCommission decided in 1994 to undertake the prepara-tion of Quality Status Reports (QSRs) for five regions ofthe North-East Atlantic: Region I, Arctic Waters; Region II,the Greater North Sea; Region III, the Celtic Seas; RegionIV, the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast; Region V, theWider Atlantic. These regions cover the entire maritimearea of the OSPAR Convention (Figure 1.1). Earlier workdone within the framework of the 1993 North Sea QSR,the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme(AMAP) and the Irish Sea Co-ordination Group was takeninto account.These regional QSRs, which have been publishedseparately, form the basis for this Quality Status Report2000. This provides a holistic and integrated summary ofthe status of the entire OSPAR maritime area.To monitor environmental quality throughout the North-East Atlantic, the OSPAR Commission adopted a JointAssessment and Monitoring Programme (JAMP). TheJAMP builds upon experience gained through amongstothers the former Joint Monitoring Programme of the Osloand Paris Commissions and the Monitoring Master Plan ofthe North Sea Task Force (NSTF). Under the JAMPumbrella, new guidelines and assessment tools havebeen developed.The Ministerial Meeting of the OSPAR Commission inSintra (Portugal) in July 1998 agreed on strategies aimedat guiding the future work of the Commission. In 1998 and1999 the Commission adopted strategies for the purposeof directing its work in the medium- to long-term in fivemain areas, i.e. the protection and conservation of theecosystems and biological diversity of the maritime area,hazardous substances, radioactive substances,combating eutrophication, and environmental goals andmanagement mechanisms for offshore activities.Together with the QSR 2000 and the JAMP thesestrategies form a vital basis for OSPAR’s activities.This report describes the natural features of coastaland offshore environments of the OSPAR area andidentifies impacts arising from human activities. Ingeneral, the report summarises information available tomid-1998, focusing in particular on environmentalchanges and the extent to which these result from humanactivities, natural variability, or both. Another objective wasto identify those gaps in scientific knowledge whichcurrently impede the assessment of the environmentalsignificance of certain activities and conditions andconsequently to support management and policy formula-tion. The various natural processes and human-madepressures on the area are analysed and compared takinginto account their severity and scale as well as their long-term significance for the environment, human health,resources and amenities. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the priorities for new, or revised, policies and management interventions that would strengthen marineenvironmental protection.";0.002;[No author name available];#NV;Getting the story across;Ten years of experience with carbon capture and storage on Sleipner East in the North Sea is worth having when studying value chains for this greenhouse gas.

The effects of a North Sea crude oil on a common European salt marsh vegetation, involving Halimione, Puccinellia, Spartina, and Triglochin, were tested in some greenhouse experiments. The oil causes a dose dependent decrease in biomass production, mainly due to oil deposition on the leaves. In some cases Puccinellia and Triglochin do not show a significant growth reduction in mixed vegetation. When only the soil is polluted by oil, a stimulation of the biomass production can be seen, especially on nitrogen-poor soils, indicating improved nutrition, probably due to enhanced N fixation.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that continued emissions of greenhouse gases at or above current rates will cause further warming and will cause many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century. These are expected to be greater than those observed during the 20th century. Atmospheric  and  ocean  climate  are  closely  coupled,  with  the  ocean  playing  a  significant  role  in  regulating  global and regional climate and weather patterns. The warming of the oceans accounts for more than 80% of the  change  in  the  energy  content  of  the  Earth’s  climate  system  over  the  last  50  years.  Increased  concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are also making the oceans more acidic. This assessment details the wide range of impacts on marine ecosystems that have been linked to changing climate.  These  include  both  the  direct  physical  and  chemical  impacts  on  the  marine  environment  (Table  1)  and the subsequent impacts occurring in the ecosystems and their biodiversity (Table 2). Many of the observed physical and chemical changes are consistent with increasing atmospheric CO2 and a warming  climate  (e.g.  rising  sea  temperature,  reduced  sea  ice  and  acidification)  but  many  of  the  causative  links to climatic changes are still not well understood. It is difficult to predict the precise rate and magnitude of  change  (e.g.  sea  level  rise,  slowed  Atlantic  circulation,  reduced  sea  ice  extent,  acidification,  increased  freshwater  input)  and  direction  of  change  (e.g.  ocean  uptake  of  CO2,  salinity;  storminess,  nutrient  enrichment),  and  to  map  impacts  at  local  level  (e.g.  coastal  erosion,  storminess,  stratification,  nutrient  enrichment). Physical  and  chemical  changes  have  directly  been  linked  to  impacts  on  marine  biota  (e.g.  range  shifts  in  plankton,  fish  and  intertidal  species  communities)  and  are  suggested  to  have  important  secondary  effects  (e.g.  prey  availability  for  seabirds).  Uncertainties  about  physical  changes  make  it  difficult  to  predict  the  effects of stratification on primary production, storminess on seabird nesting sites and nutrient enrichment on harmful  algae  blooms.  Our  understanding  of  the  links  between  climate  change  and  impacts  on  marine  ecosystems  also  remains  limited  due  to  insufficient  data  (e.g.  marine  mammals;  benthic  ecology;  intertidal  communities)  and  the  difficulties  in  establishing  a  link  to  local  effects  (e.g.  occurrence  of  harmful  algal  blooms, establishment of non-indigenous species).";0.040999999999999995;Wolff W.J.;Inst Forestry & Nature Rsch, PO Box 23, Wageningen, The Netherlands;Impact of climate change on the Wadden Sea;Summarizes studies on the effect of climate change on the estuarine Dutch Wadden Sea. Increased concentration of carbon dioxide is expected to have a rather small effect on saltmarsh vegetation and a negligible effect on the functioning of the Wadden Sea ecosystem. Rates of sealevel rise of 60 and 85 cm per century are not expected to have a major impact on the geomorphology of tidal basins because of increased sedimentation. Also saltmarsh accretion may be able to keep pace with these rates of sealevel rise.

During two cruises, one to the North Atlantic and one to the North Sea, we investigated the distribution of capsulated bacteria throughout the water column. Capsulated bacteria were generally more abundant in eutrophic surface waters than in deeper layers or more oligotrophic regions. In the upper 100 m of the North Atlantic, about 6-14% of the total bacterioplankton community was capsulated, while in the layers below 100 m depth, 97% of the bacteria lacked a visible capsule. The percentage of capsulated bacteria correlated with bacterial abundance and production, and chlorophyll a concentration. Also, the bioavailabillty of DOC (dissolved organic carbon), estimated by the ratio between bacterial production and DOC concentration, significantly correlated with the percentage of capsulated bacteria. In the North Sea, the contribution of capsulated bacteria to the total number of bacteria decreased from the surface (3 m depth) to the near-bottom (25-35 m) layers from 20% to 14% capsulated bacteria. In the nearshore area of the North Sea, about 27% of the bacteria exhibited a capsule. Overall, a pronounced decrease in the contribution of capsulated bacteria to the total bacterial abundance was detectable from the eutrophic coastal environment to the open North Atlantic. Using this epifluorescence-based technique to enumerate capsulated bacterioplankton thus allowed us to routinely assess the number of capsulated bacteria even in the oceanic water column.

Therefore, new coastal developments will take place in Danish areas. The impact of waves on atmosphere is most often described by roughness length, which is typically determined by the Charnock formulation. This simplification in many atmospheric models has been shown to bring bias in the estimation of the extreme wind. Some wave-dependent formulations have been reported to overestimate the drag coefficient and roughness, but new roughness formulations have been proposed to better estimate wave-wind interactions according to observations. In the present work, an assessment of several roughness descriptions is performed, and implications for coastal wind and wave modelling are studied. An atmospheric (WRF) and spectral wave model (MIKE 21 SW) are implemented for the North Sea in order to consider wave effects on roughness. The objective is to see the reaction of an atmospheric model to the water surface description through offline coupling. A comparison with three simplified roughness formulations embedded in WRF showed a 50% variation in roughness and 20% in wind, with the better formulation for wind leading degraded predictions of roughness compared with observations. The large estimates of roughness when using a 3rd generation wave model are evident offshore, while a roughness formulation based on wave age produces more realistic values. However, at a coastal site, both estimates were within the same range. The impact of roughness on the wave model is discussed in terms of an idealized case for fetch-limited wave growth.;2014;Conference Paper;Proceedings of the Coastal Engineering Conference;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957684697&partnerID=40&md5=e9173dc2c9f2ed3e90565d1e3ae8bee9;Scopus;csv;7808;0.6955982522020258;9315;True;#NV

Div., Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany;Measuring equipment for determining the risk of local pollution layers on H.V. insulators;As a result of the deposition of solid particles coupled with moisture, conductive surface pollution layers are formed on the insulators of high voltage equipment and overhead lines and these can lead to flashover across the insulators without the simultaneous occurrence of overvoltages. Laboratory investigations and tests have shown that the conductivity of these surface pollution layers and the resultant current which flows across the surface of the insulator are decisive factors in the reduction of the insulating capacity with respect to the normal, continuously applied operating voltage. This paper describes an automatically operating and recording test unit which has been designed for the measurement of this conductivity, and that has been tested out in the North Sea coastal area. Results to date suggest that the measuring equipment will provide a means of determining the local risk of pollution and thus of predetermining the local reduction in insulation. It follows that the future offers the possibility of matching the insulators to be used in a given area to the local risk of pollution.Conductive pollution layers on insulator surfaces affect the external insulation of h. v. equipment and overhead lines and reduce its resistance to the operating voltage. A measuring unit has been designed to determine the risk presented by such layers. It measurs the surface current on a shed-free cylindrical insulator. The equipment was used initially in the North Sea coastal area of Germany. It has a warning device which operates when the current exceeds a preset value. This permits the insulator to be cleaned or other measures to be adopted before a fault occurs.;1975;Article;SIEMENS REV.;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0016422738&partnerID=40&md5=f7ac304f1eacdab26e25963214784158;Scopus;csv;1111;0.7086191543724466;2618;True;#NV

A revised version of the directive followed in 2006 (2), updating the measures of the 1976 legislation and simplifying its management and surveillance methods. This revised directive also provides for better and timelier public information about bathing water quality.

Nevertheless,  the  utilisation  of  renewable  sources  of  energy  can  also  have  an  adverse impact  on  the  environment  and  our  natural  resources.  Since  2001,  OSPAR  and  its  Biodiversity  Committee (BDC)  have  been  noting  that  the  offshore  wind  energy  sector  has  been  rapidly  expanding  in  the  OSPAR maritime area. In  order  to  better  understand  the  situation  and  to  help  authorities  to  manage  potential  conflicting objectives and the expanding use of these offshore installations in an ecologically sustainable way, OSPAR agreed on a programme of work on the environmental impact of offshore wind-farms. As part of this programme of work on wind-farms, OSPAR  has produced the OSPAR Database on  Offshore Wind-farms,  which  constitutes  an  inventory  of  all  planned  (under  application),  authorised,  refused, operational,  out  of  service  and  decommissioned  wind-farms  installations  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the OSPAR Contracting Parties.  The  OSPAR  Database  on  Offshore  Wind-farms  provides  to  the  public  information,  for  each  offshore installation, regarding  (1)  its  name,  (2)  location, (3)  distance  from  the  coast,  (4)  number of wind  turbines, (5) current status, (6) capacity in MW, (7) foundations type, (8) water depth, (9) height, (10) environmental impact  information  and  (11)  additional  remarks.  In  order  to  better  understand  the  terminology  used,  the Explanatory  Notes  at  Annex  1  describe  the  terms  used  and  the  way  in  which  Contracting  Parties  should report their data by adhering to this terminology. The  database  is  completed  with  the  maps  of  locations  of  wind-farms  in  the  OSPAR  Maritime  Area.

The wind speed maps are regridded to 400 m by 400 m in order to reduce noise. Each of the wind maps are compared to high-quality meteorological in-situ observations collected from a 62 m tall mast located 14 km offshore.

This  document  focuses  on  the  evaluation  of  the  first  set  of  Ecological  Quality  Objectives  (EcoQOs)  which  are  being  applied  in  the  North  Sea  and  provides  suggestions for future steps. The  main  added  value  of  the  EcoQO  system  lies  at  present  in  providing  examples  of  objectives  and  indicators  that  can  be  used  to  define  Good  Environmental  Status  (GES)  under  the  Marine  Strategy  Framework  Directive  (MSFD).  Using  the  developing  framework  for  biodiversity  monitoring  and  assessment,  led  by  the  UK,  they  can  contribute  to  a  well-structured  and  effective  monitoring  programme.  However,  the  generic  qualitative  descriptors  of  GES  are  only  partly  addressed  by  the  current  EcoQOs.  Therefore,  OSPAR  needs  to  start  filling  the  gaps  as  soon  as  possible,  using  the  same  framework  for  biodiversity  monitoring  and  assessment  to  identify  the  most  important  issues.  Also,  in  view  of  the  MSFD,  OSPAR  needs  to  work  on  a  complete  and  coherent  set  of  EcoQOs  for  OSPAR regions beyond the North Sea.  The evaluation of the current set of EcoQOs shows that very few are being met. In a number of cases monitoring  and/or  reporting  is  inadequate  to  enable  a  full  evaluation.  There  is,  therefore,  a  need  to  improve the implementation of EcoQOs, and in particular monitoring across the North Sea to improve this  evaluation.  Most  of  the  EcoQOs  would  gain  in  strength  and  usefulness  if  all  Contracting  Parties  invested  the  necessary  resources  to  support  the  EcoQOs  and  re-emphasised  their  commitment  to  maximise   the   relevance   for   the   European   MSFD.   Recommendations   are   made   for   improved   implementation and adjustment of some of the EcoQOs. Recommendations are made on the relation between EcoQOs and the GES, on future development, communication and commitment.  Better communication of the EcoQO system is needed, primarily to key marine user groups, but also to  the  wider  public.

It argues that economic activities including transport, fishing, offshore energy and tourism should be better managed so that they ensure sustainable health of marine ecosystems.;0.001;Bolaños R., Larsén X.G., Petersen O.S., Nielsen J.R., Kelly M., Kofoed-Hansen H., Du J., Sørensen O.R., Larsen S.E., Hahmann A.N., Badger M.;"DHI, Agern Allé 5, Hørsholm, DK-2970, Denmark; DTU Wind Energy, Risø Campus, Frederiksborgvej 399, Roskilde, DK-4000, Denmark";Coupling atmospherere and waves for coastal wind turbine design;Offshore wind farms in coastal areas are considered by the Danish government to contribute to the goal of having 50% of the energy consumption from renewable sources by 2025. Therefore, new coastal developments will take place in Danish areas. The impact of waves on atmosphere is most often described by roughness length, which is typically determined by the Charnock formulation. This simplification in many atmospheric models has been shown to bring bias in the estimation of the extreme wind. Some wave-dependent formulations have been reported to overestimate the drag coefficient and roughness, but new roughness formulations have been proposed to better estimate wave-wind interactions according to observations. In the present work, an assessment of several roughness descriptions is performed, and implications for coastal wind and wave modelling are studied. An atmospheric (WRF) and spectral wave model (MIKE 21 SW) are implemented for the North Sea in order to consider wave effects on roughness. The objective is to see the reaction of an atmospheric model to the water surface description through offline coupling. A comparison with three simplified roughness formulations embedded in WRF showed a 50% variation in roughness and 20% in wind, with the better formulation for wind leading degraded predictions of roughness compared with observations. The large estimates of roughness when using a 3rd generation wave model are evident offshore, while a roughness formulation based on wave age produces more realistic values. However, at a coastal site, both estimates were within the same range. The impact of roughness on the wave model is discussed in terms of an idealized case for fetch-limited wave growth.;2014;Conference Paper;Proceedings of the Coastal Engineering Conference;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957684697&partnerID=40&md5=e9173dc2c9f2ed3e90565d1e3ae8bee9;Scopus;csv;7808;0.7399024256167114;9315;True;#NV

The constant battering requires these areas to have extensive sea walls in order to prevent major erosion and loss of existing infrastructure. Such is the case in Scarborough, where the sea walls protecting the Castle Headlands and Harbour are coming to the end of their useful life and are in need of repair to ensure protection for years to come. The Scarborough Borough Council recently approved the completion of a $26 million (US $40 million) sea wall rebuilding campaign in order to protect their important coastline. The project will safeguard a 1 1/4- mile (2.1 km) stretch of coastline along the The Holms, Castle Headlands and East Pier region and is scheduled to take up to two years to complete. Good progress has been made on the project and the companies involved are scheduled to complete the project in the Spring of 2004. The project calls for installation of up to 308,560 tons (280,000 t) of granite rocks from Larvic, Norway, weighing up to 22 tons (20 t) each, to build rock armour protection around The Holms, Castle Headland and East Pier. Pre-cast interlocking concrete blocks called Acropodes will also be used on Castle Headland and East Pier. These installations will require the drilling of 605 × 34 in (864 mm) piles into the seabed to a depth of 9 to 15 ft (3-5 m) in medium sandstone and mudstone. Of these 605 holes, 240 will be drilled on the beach at low tide with the remaining 355 completed at sea.;0.998;Gliedman M.L., Grant R.N., Vestal B.L., Karlson K.E.;Department of Surgery, Surgical Research Laboratory, U.

These works have produced a de facto compartmentalisation of the formerly more or less continuous estuarine area. We now have a saline tidal sea arm (Oosterschelde), saline and brackish stagnant lakes (Grevelingen and Veerse Meer, respectively), as well as remnants of the estuarine habitat (Westerschelde, Nieuwe Waterweg). A comparison of the recent situation with the one that existed before any great alterations took place shows: 1. Species richness of the marine flora on this (regional/local) scale is largely dependent on salinity. 2. An overall rise in number of species of brown and red algae is apparent. Among the ten distinguished sectors of the SW Netherlands the steepest rises occured in the tidal saline Oosterschelde and the stagnant saline Grevelingen, probably caused by the now continuously high salinity and clear water. 3. A great impact of alien imports ('exotics') is visible in the sheltered Oosterschelde and Grevelingen, ȧ much smaller impact on the exposed North Sea coast and in the estuarine brackish Westerschelde. 4. There is not much indication of reductions in species areas, in the red algae rather the reverse seems true. 5. This study demonstrates a case where human interference has produced an increased species diversity in the marine environment by creating more diverse habitats. As such it is merely a continuation of a process that has been going on in the SW Netherlands during the last few centuries.;0.135;Petzelberger B.E.M., Behre K.-E., Geyh M.A.;Nieder.

Former investigations have already shown an Atlantic or Subboreal age for the base of some of these bogs. The aim of the new project is to find out whether there were one or several starting phases for the formation of raised bogs and to check any possible synchroneity over large areas. Selected bogs were drilled in a grid and samples from the base of these raised bogs have been analysed for the 14C-age. The goal was to date extensive environmental changes. The so far obtained results presented here from the Oldenburgisch-Ostfriesischen Hohenrucken allow a first interpretation. According to the 14C-data a climate change induced by the Holocene marine transgression of the North Sea triggered the formation of raised bogs in Northwest Germany.

The development includes a fully integrated fixed steel production, drilling and quarters platform and liquid and gas trunklines to shore. The design takes advantage of the reservoir pressure of 775 bar that is sufficient to flow gas from the field through the pipeline to shore.

The report, which focused on the North Sea, was reviewed and updated in 1998, and is currently subject to a further revision. This new report addresses discharge, fate and potential environmental impact of produced water to the marine environment from a wider, global perspective. The focus of the review is primarily on produced water impact, and takes into account a number of comprehensive studies that have been completed during the past 5 years. In addition, information and data on environmental effects of naturally-occurring, 'non-oil', constituents forms an important contribution to the report. It is clear that produced water, in general, poses a limited threat to marine ecosystems. Local effects have been observed in shallow waters. Regulation and legislation practices on produced water vary significantly on a global scale, but in many areas are still based principally on concentration standards of oil in water. In some areas, in addition to performance standards, there is also a requirement for biological testing and discharge modelling studies. Environmental risk and impact assessments have, during the past decade, found broader application in areas such as the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The paper will present the results of the review and will serve as a basis for further discussion on produced water environmental management in the industry and in the regulatory and scientific and wider stakeholder communities.;2004;Conference Paper;International Conference on Health, Safety and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2942592588&partnerID=40&md5=c3e675820165c1dcaf7d63536b334a82;Scopus;csv;3911;0.7553487236141402;5418;True;#NV

Furthermore a concentration of deposited material is observed at two locations. One of these is the area of the 'Rhinplatte', equidistant between the Hamburg harbour and the entrance to the North Sea. New approaches with respect to maintenance strategy are required in order to reduce costs. The study has demonstrated that a WI dredge could successfully operate in large tidal rivers. Therefore the advantages of WID techniques should be considered with regard to the maintenance strategy at the 'Rhinplatte' site in the future. The physical and environmental impacts of WID dredging were well described through use of a balanced suite of acoustic and monitoring methods. The changes in sediment characteristics were very successfully described with the QTC VIEW and QTC IMPACT acoustic bottom classification system.;0.064;Surlyk F.;Geological Institute, University of Copenhagen, Geocenter Copenhagen, Øster Voldgade 10, Copenhagen K DK-1350, Denmark;The Jurassic of East Greenland: A sedimentary record of thermal subsidence, onset and culmination of rifting;The Late Palaeozoic - Mesozoic extensional basin complex of East Greenland contains a record of deposition during a period of Rhaetian - Early Bajocian thermal subsidence, the onset of rifting in the Late Bajocian, its growth during the Bathonian-Kimmeridgian, culmination of rifting in the Volgian - Early Ryazanian, and waning in the Late Ryazanian - Hauterivian. The area was centred over a palaeolatitude of about 45°N in the Rhaetian and drifted northwards to about 50°N in the Hauterivian. A major climate change from arid to humid subtropical conditions took place at the Norian-Rhaetian transition. Deposition was in addition governed by a long-term sea-level rise with highstands in the Toarcian-Aalenian, latest Callovian and Kimmeridgian, and lowstands in the latest Bajocian - earliest Bathonian, Middle Oxfordian and Volgian. The Rhaetian - Lower Bajocian succession is considered the upper part of a megasequence, termed J1, with its base in the upper Lower Triassic, whereas the Upper Bajocian - Hauterivian succession forms a complete, syn-rift megasequence, termed J2. The southern part of the basin complex in Jameson Land contains a relatively complete Rhaetian-Ryazanian succession and underwent only minor tilting during Middle Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous rifting. Rhaetian-Lower Jurassic deposits are absent north of Jameson Land and this region was fragmented into strongly tilted fault blocks during the protracted rift event. The syn-rift successions of the two areas accordingly show different long-term trends in sedimentary facies. In the southern area, the J2 syn-rift megasequence forms a symmetrical regressive-transgressive-regressive cycle, whereas the J2 megasequence in the northern area shows an asymmetrical, stepwise deepening trend. A total of eight tectonostratigraphic sequences are recognised in the Rhaetian-Hauterivian interval. They reflect major changes in basin configuration, drainage systems, sediment transport and distribution patterns, and in facies and depositional environments. The sequences are bounded by regional unconformities or flooding surfaces and have average durations in the order of 10 Ma. They are subdivided into conventional unconformity-bounded depositional sequences with durations ranging from tens of thousands of years, in the Milankovitch frequency band, up to several million years. Deposition was alluvial and lacustrine in the Rhaetian-Sinemurian, but almost exclusively marine during the Pliensbachian-Hauterivian time interval when a marine strait, up to 500 km wide and more than 2000 km long, developed between Greenland and Norway, connecting the Arctic Sea and the North Sea. Coal-bearing fluvial and paralic deposits occur, however, at the base of the onlapping Middle Jurassic succession in the central and northern part of the basin complex. The sedimentary development is similar to that in the Northern North Sea and on the Norwegian shelf, and East Greenland offers important onshore analogues for virtually all of the types of deeply buried Jurassic depositional systems of these areas and especially their hydrocarbon reservoirs. © GEUS, 2003.;2003;Article;Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1842786507&partnerID=40&md5=6b2afeb4283078316a593e7f21d6cddf;Scopus;csv;4118;0.7594107770245015;5625;True;#NV

However, many of the terms in Annex I and numerous definitions in the Interpretation Manual have proved to be impractical or insufficient, causing some difficulties in selecting the sites. In some cases the selection of priority habitats seems to be not appropriate for North-West Germany. Furthermore, many of the most typical and endangered habitats of North-West Germany are missing in Annex I, for example: Sand beaches of the North Sea, eutrophic lakes and ponds with waterlily-vegetation and reed beds, mesophile pastures, non-dunal sand grasslands, grasslands with fluvial flood swards and the whole range of cutrophic fens and marshes with alder swamp woods, willow scrubs, sedge or reed beds and subatlantic humid meadows (Calthion). Only few of these habitats can be identified as core areas of FFH-sites due to the occurrence of plants or animals of Annex II.

The aim was to ensure the stability of the solid coastal protection structures. The beach nourishment has been repeatedly carried out at irregular intervals since 1951. This paper reviews some effects of the last beach restoration on the sediment distribution in spring 1989. The beach was partly refilled with well sorted fine sand. The mean grain size of the original beach sediments was much coarser. Sediment samples were taken twice yearly to obtain an overall view of long-term changes of the sediment distribution. Samples taken at monthly intervals, mainly in the problematic zone of severe erosion, gave information on short-term changes. The grain size distribution, carbonate and heavy mineral contents were determined. At first, after the beach nourishment, a strongly decreasing grain size was detected, but soon reversed. Despite a selective erosion of finer sediment particles and the relative enrichment of coarser grains, the grain size spectrum of the beach refilling as it was before the replenishment was observed in the spring of 1991. The natural grain size distribution which is in an equilibrium with the hydrodynamic forces was produced by erosion of the beach material. The fine grained sand used as the refill is a ''foreign'' material that does not correspond to the boundary conditions at this site. The examination of heavy minerals provides information about transport directions of the beach and shoreface sediments. It shows that the cross-shore transport is dominant within the groin-fields. The grain size of the sediments of the refilled area does not differ very much from those of the shoreface sediments, and thus this parameter is unsuitable for an analysis of the along-shore transport of the sediment. Although, an eastward and southward along-shore transport could be revealed from the refilled beach section after the nourishment. A survey of the beach and shoreface morphology provides additional information on the sediment transport and temporal sediment volume development.;0.848;DAVIS JG, DOREMUS GL, GRAHAM FW;#NV;INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THE DESIGN OF CATHODIC PROTECTION SYSTEMS FOR MARINE STRUCTURES;Environmental conditions should and definitely do influence the design of cathodic protection systems for corrosion mitigation on marine structures in all areas of the world.

It is essential for production that integrity is maintained to ensure a long safe lifetime of the pipelines and keeping downtime to a minimum. Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) causes development of localized attack and internal channeling corrosion, which pose a challenge to the long term integrity of pipelines. MIC risk assessment requires a monitoring program to determine numbers and activity of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes and methanogens. To provide the most representative samples, pigging debris was collected regularly from pipelines in the Danish Sector of the North Sea. Quantitative data on microbial activity using qPCR/RT-qPCR of MIC-causing microorganisms in seven pipelines and model prediction of MIC risk showed that the highest risk was present in multiphase pipelines operated at inlet temperatures in the range of 53 - 66 °C. The predicted maximum pitting corrosion rate was <0.51 mm/year and the estimated pigging frequency was 37 days to counteract MIC based on pigging debris samples.

Data were taken in July 1980, one month after dumping ended, and in April 1981. pH-value, redox potential of the interstitial water, amount of sand in the sediment as well as total number of species and diversity were lower in the dumping area than outside, whereas alkalinity and water content of the sediment were higher. Due to mass development of a few species around the dumping site, biomass and number of individuals were high in July. Abundance and biomass values were lower in April. 2 communities are described and related to abiotic parameters such as sediment structure. Due to disturbance effects of sewage sludge, 2 stages of the second successional phase (Pearson &amp; Rosenberg, 1978) were ascertained, described by one of these communities each time. The first faunal community, characterized by an Abra alba assemblage, describes an early stage of the second successional phase. In summer (July) the Abra alba community showed a wider spatial range than in spring. The other, dominated by Nucula nitida, indicated a later stage of the second succession phase that was passing to the third phase. © 1990 Biologische Anstalt Helgoland.";0.16399999999999998;Cabantous A.;UA 04-1020 du CNRS, Lille, France., France;(Some features of the fishing communities in northern France from the seventeenth century to 1850).

The latter frequently contain anoxic water. To the west and north the coast is characterised by a shallow shelf, islands and deep and long fjords dissecting the coastline. These fjords are usually well ventilated due to deep sills. The long coastline encompasses gradients in climate, depth regimes, physio-chemical factors and varied biological habitats. The majority of the human population is situated along the coast and the environmental impact from domestic and industrial waste is particularly noticeable on the southern coastline where the fjords are not very suitable as recipients of waste. As a consequence of the pollution, health warnings have been issued concerning consumption of seafood in more than 10 fjords due to high levels of contaminants (dioxins, PCBs, PAHs, cadmium). Remedial actions have been taken to reduce contaminant input during the last decade, and one of the main environmental challenges at the turn of the millennium will be to reduce the impacts from secondary sources (contaminated sediments and dump sites). Offshore the main challenge will be to assess the potential effects of large volumes of contaminated produced water, and management of the many drilling waste piles on the seabed when the fields are closed down. An overall challenge for the Norwegian coast is the potential impact of climatic changes altering the major current systems, the fresh water input and the transboundary impacts from downstream effects of atmospheric and water transport of contaminants.;0.037000000000000005;Zijlstra J.J.;Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, PO Box 59, 1790 AB Den Burg (The Netherlands), Netherlands;The North Sea ecosystem;Describes the topography, hydrography, nutrients, salinity, phytoplankton, primary production, zooplankton, benthos, and fish and fisheries of the North Sea.

Catches and production of flatfishes are probably highest in the S, but zooplankton production and total fish production (including pelagic fish) increase from S→N. Long-term changes are noted in plankton and fisheries: diatoms and zooplankton showed a decline from 1948-78 (probably a consequence of climatic change), and in the same period (but especially in the 1960s) such major fish stocks as herring Clupea harengus and mackerel Scomber scombrus showed a substantial decline (climatic change and/or changes in fishing effort).

Following the German Ordinance for Offshore Installations permission cannot be given if flora and fauna will be affected by the installation. Wind energy plants in the offshore area are a new technique and a thorough assessment of their effects on nature is impossible at the moment. Nevertheless, likely and possible effects could be deduced from experiences on land. Thus it has to be expected that roosting, feeding or migrating sea birds will be affected due to disturbance and collision. At least on a local scale the foundations will destroy the benthos but due to their effects on the hydrology and the sedimentation pattern they may change the composition of benthic communities on a larger scale as well. Furthermore they form an artificial hard substrate that serves as habitat for epibenthic flora and fauna not typically found in great parts of the German part of the North Sea. It should be feared that artificial magnetic and electric fields generated by the cable links will affect small and large scale orientation of fishes and marine mammals. Additional disturbances could arise from noise and vibrations released into the water column as well as from the shadows generated by the turning mills. Although these wind parks at least partly will be placed far off-shore a visual disturbance of the landscape has to be expected just as on land. In addition off-shore wind parks will increase the collision risk for ships and accidents may affect areas even far away from the wind park, e.g. by oil spills. In conclusion there is sufficient reason to assume a considerable risk that off-shore wind parks will affect the environment. So far only wind parks consisting of a few mills should be placed. They have to been seen as case studies to enable the necessary research on their effects on nature. © 1999 Bundesamt für Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie.;0.04;Scheibe K., Birk C., Schmarbeck S.;Fachhochschule Kiel, Grenzstraße 5, D-24149 Kiel, Germany;Lightning current measurement for future offshore windfarms in the north sea [Blitzstrommessungen für künftige Offshore-Windparks in der Nordsee];With regard to the climate change, more and more power-stations with renewable energies are being constructed The Federal Republic of Germany strives for a development of the renewable energies and demands up to 2020 a share of 20% in the energy supply .Suitable areas are suggested and approved at present so that a predefined aim can be expected from 25-30 GW to 2030.

M.;Lophelia pertusa is a cold-water coral most frequently reported on the shelf edge and offshore banks of the north east Atlantic. The occurrence of this and other conspicuous large epifauna on moorings 2 km from an oil production platform in the North Sea were recorded from video surveys by remotely operated vehicle. Sea anemones and soft corals were abundant and a total of 133 colonies of L. pertusa were observed. These occurrences and those on the Brent Spar are the first documented reports of live L. pertusa in the North Sea. L. pertusa was restricted in its distribution to water >70 m, below the seasonal thermocline in the northern North Sea. It is estimated that coral sampled from a single point mooring had a linear extension rate of at least 5 mm per year, a rate comparable with existing estimates. It seems likely that these colonies will have originated from populations along the Atlantic margin with larvae transported into the northern North Sea in cooled Atlantic water, possibly via the east Shetland Atlantic Inflow current. The implications of this finding in terms of the environmental sensitivity of this species remain unclear since it is not known to what extent they have been exposed to any drilling discharges.

Chronological analyses on the communities and on the dominant Abra alba species show that the overall changes are different among the sites in spite of similar climatic environments all with a 7-year cycle and a similar type of community. Two main lessons appear: 1. It is absolutely necessary to have reference sites to measure the effect of a perturbation, 2. The responses are specific.

What is new is the concentration of these operations in the North Sea.

This is primarily due to the presence of highly developed industry (located in large cities on the coast, thus reducing transportation costs), agriculture and intensive transportation flows in the Baltic countries. In addition, because of the relatively weak vertical convection currents an influence of extremely polluted waters from the North Sea is characteristic for the Baltic Sea (the North Sea waters formerly saturated the water of the Baltic Sea with oxygen, but now only impair its quality). In 1976 a special resolution was adopted in the USSR defining a long term program of environmental protection and rational utilization of the natural resources of the Baltic Sea. The planned set of technical measures will result in the complete cessation of the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic effluent into the Baltic Sea basin in several years. At the same time a regional scheme for the protection of natural conditions and the rational use of natural resources in the coastal region of the Baltic Sea over the long term is being developed so as to secure the most optimum development of this region in subsequent five year plan periods. The growing flow of pollutants from the North Sea, which is due to the stepped up discharge of pollutants by the chemical industry of the Western European countries, presents a particular threat. This process can be prevented only by developing international measures and incorporating zero waste technological plants in these countries. An overall systematic analysis of the ecological situation in the Baltic Sea zone requires the compilation of an inventory of waste products and a broader study of the influence of the North Sea. All the necessary conditions exist and all the necessary steps are being taken to prevent pollution of the Baltic Sea under the conditions of the planned socialist economy. Expansion of contacts with other Baltic and North Sea countries can secure more rational forms for the use of this part of the World Ocean. (19 references).;1978;Article;SOV. CHEM.

The authors assume that a 100 m high stack of a 1000 MW(e) nuclear power plant lines up with a wet cooling tower in the main wind direction. The mechanism of mixing at various wind velocities is discussed. As compared with the dry off-gas plume, two additional mechanisms influencing the radiological effect of the released activity come into play: the activity concentration near the ground is reduced by the strong buoyancy of the moist plume; and the wash-out of aerosols by natural precipitation is increased. The radiological effect of noble fission gas release is reduced, but in the case of radioiodine the two effects partly compensate each other. Future reactors intended for large nuclear power plant sites should be equipped with an effective iodine retention system.

Therefore, every year all gull eggs were removed up to 1968. After this year both species showed a steep increase (Fig. 6). Griend currently holds around 30,000 breeding pairs of Black-headed Gull (Fig. 1 ), 25% of the Dutch population and 61 % of the population in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. Breeding success on Griend averaged 1.0 fledged young per breeding pair in 1994-2008 (Fig. 2), indicating that Griend is a favourable breeding area. It is argued that data on breeding success are only reliable when measured in fenced enclosures. We analysed 170 recoveries of 109 ringed Black-headed Gulls breeding on Griend in 1999-2001. The recoveries revealed several examples of natal dispersal and breeding dispersal towards Griend, mostly from other colonies in the Wadden Sea (Fig. 5), but also by gulls born in Belgium, France and the UK, indicating that natal dispersal can occur over long distances. Since the eighties Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes recolonized areas along the mainland coast of the Wadden Sea, which caused major changes in the distribution of Black-headed Gulls (Fig. 7). Recoveries show that natal and breeding dispersal from colonies along the mainland coast towards Griend have occurred, and thus the desertion of the mainland colonies will partly have caused the huge numbers currently breeding on Griend. A considerable number of ringed subadults seen on Griend during the breeding season originate from countries around the Baltic Sea (Table 1), but no ringed adults from the Baltic population were seen during the breeding season. This finding agrees with a lack of confirmed breeding records of birds from the Baltic population in the northern part of The Netherlands. We discuss various biases that are present in the ring recoveries. The recovery pattern of foreign-ringed birds (Fig. 3) is strongly skewed towards activities of British ringers, and the age pattern of the breeding birds (Fig. 4) is skewed towards our activities on Griend as well. Nevertheless, the recoveries have significantly improved our insight in trends and dispersal of Black-headed Gulls on Griend and in the Wadden Sea.;0.715;Reinicke K.M., Fichter C.;ITE-Institut für Erdöl- und Erdgastechnik, TU Clausthal, Germany;Grid connection of large offshore wind turbines - Baseload power from the north sea [Bohr-und produktionstechnische fragestellungen bei gemeinsamer entwicklung von windparks und erdgasvorkommen (Clausthaler konzept)];"Alpha Venlus is Germany's first major offshore wind farm.

Sea water was used to grow ice sheets which were broken to produce the required ice cover. Two types of North Sea crude oils (Gullfaks and Oseberg) as well as Bunker fuel were used. Oil samples were spilled on the broken ice/ slush covers at an approximately constant flow rate. Analysis of the video records gives maximum spill dimensions, spreading rates, and ratio of the oil-covered area to the total area of the spill. The results show that oil always flowed over the brash ice, and the surface tension plays a more significant role than viscosity in decreasing oil spreading. Measured slick dimensions were used to develop empirical expressions for the balance of gravity, surface tension and viscous forces.;0.79;Darvish G.R., Lindeberg E., Holt T., Utne S.A.;"SPE, SINTEF, NTNU, Norway; SPE, SINTEF, Norway; SPE, ResLab. A/S; SINTEF, Norway";Laboratory experiments of tertiary CO2 injection into a fractured core;The efficiency of tertiary CO2 injection at the reservoir conditions into fractured cores has been investigated experimentally. The experiment was designed to illustrate the process of water imbibition and CO2 injection into a North Sea chalk reservoir. The core and core holder assembly were designed to allow a 2 mm gap to surround the core simulating a fracture. Live reservoir oil was prepared and used to saturate the matrix system. Due to the large permeability contrast between the core (4 mD) and the fracture it is not feasible to saturate the core by simply flooding the system with live oil, since oil would flow through the fracture and only partially saturate the core. To overcome this problem a unique technique has been developed for saturating the matrix system with reservoir fluids. This method ensures a homogeneous fluid composition within the pore system before the fracture system is initialized by the injection fluids (water/CO2). During the experiment, the matrix system was first saturated with the live reservoir oil, during which the gap was blocked by a sealing material. In the next step the sealing material was removed and water was injected into the gap. Finally CO2 was injected at a low and constant rate into the gap. Oil and water production and fluid composition were monitored and the results show that injection of CO2 could significantly recover residual oil after water injection.

In the North Sea, classical ""black oils"" are still encountered; however scenarios where volatile fluids that exhibit a bubble point are found in close proximity to fluids with dew points are not uncommon. In addition, knowing the CO2 content is paramount to completion engineering and facility design with high penalties incurred when CO2 quotas or production limits are exceeded. Characterizing these fluids is difficult. Typically wireline formation testers with fluid analyzers are used for early fluid characterization and sampling. However, with the increasing fluid complexity subtle differences need to be understood. This requires comprehensive compositional analysis, high resolution answers and quantified accuracy. This paper describes the technology and answers provided by an accurate in-situ fluid analyzer. Several case studies are discussed. In the first example oil is sampled from two depths, only a few meters apart. The in-situ fluid analysis data from these two depth, including C1, C2, C3-C5, C6+ CO2, GOR and density are compared, indicating excellent tool resolution. In addition these data are compared to laboratory sample analysis result with observed differences falling well within the quoted tool accuracies. A second example involves several closely stacked reservoirs. An in-situ compositional analysis was obtained for each reservoir fluid. By changing the flow rate of the formation tester downhole pump the flowing pressure was manipulated. This allowed to measure different ranges of bubble point pressures for each fluid. Only a few meters below a second fluid exhibiting a dew point was encountered. An indication of the fluid dew point pressure was detected by again manipulating the flowing pressure. Fluid analysis revealed compartmentalization and fluid grading through the different reservoirs in this well.

Therefore, this problem is usually taken into careful consideration. The aim of the paper is to characterise the possible changes in the range of underwater devices used in conditions typical for the Southern Baltic. The main factor having an impact on the range of underwater devices, which could modify it significantly, is the variation in spatial distribution of the acoustical parameters, such as the sound speed, the nonlinear parameter B/A and the attenuation coefficient. All of the parameters change with changes in temperature and salinity, but the first and the second one depend strongly on temperature whereas the third one - attenuation coefficient - on salinity.The general trend in the changes of spatial distribution of the acoustical parameters during the year is known. The acoustical conditions in the upper layer are influenced by the flow of solar energy onto the sea surface and the acoustical parameters of the layer change seasonally. Whereas the acoustical conditions in the deep - water layer depends on inflows of highly saline water from the North Sea through the Danish Straits. However the casualistic factor modulating the acoustical conditions in the Baltic Sea plays the significant role in forming the actual situation and thus affecting the range of acoustical devices. Such anomalies are the subject of interest for exploitation of underwater devices, because they could change significantly a range of the devices. Variations in underwater acoustical range in the Southern Baltic caused by modifications in acoustical conditions are presented basing on a large number of in situ measurements.

These surveys include 17 species of colonial breeding birds and 78 rare breeders (Tab. 1) and are part of a national governmental monitoring scheme, co-ordinated by SOVON Dutch Centre for Field Ornithology. Censuses in the Wadden Sea are carried out In the framework of the trilateral monitoring programme TMAP, together with partners in Germany and Denmark. Fieldwork is mainly conducted by dedicated volunteers, staff of site-managers and nature conservation agencies as well as a number of institutes. Both fieldwork and data processing are standardised according to guidelines in a special manual. Data are transferred online at www.sovon.nl or by standardised data sheets. Coverage varies among species, but in general ail key-breeding areas, including all Natura 2000 sites, are covered annually. For some species (e.g. White Stork, Eurasian Spoonbill, Montagu's Harrier, Black Grouse, Corn Crake, Barn Owl) species-specific surveys deliver most of the data. Furthermore, a special census of breeding goose populations was carried out in 2005. Trend analyses are carried out with the common TRIM package and baseline results are reported in annual, reports. This paper summarises data from 2003-2005. Numbers, estimates, details on coverage and an assessment of trends are given in Tab. 1. For a selection of species, trends in annual (counted) numbers are shown (Fig. 3, 4, 5, 7). Additionally, a comparison is made between breeding distribution In 1998-2000 (new breeding bird atlas) and 2003-05 (this paper) to reveal some of the changes in distribution that have occurred recently in some species (Fig. 2, 6, 8-12). All three breeding seasons were preceeded by normal to mild winters (note, however, severe but short cold spells by the end of winter In 2004 and 2005). Temperatures were generally well above long-term average, confirming the global tendency for warmer winters. Spring 2003 was dry whereas July 2004 and 2005 were (extremely) wet (Fig. 1). Highlights in rare breeding birds in 2003-2005 included first breeding of Whooper Swan (2005, province Drenthe; failed), annual breeding of Common Crane (2 successful pairs in Drenthe, additional records of individuals during the breeding season), a small influx of Baillon's Crake (10 singing males in 2005), first breeding Gull-billed Tern since 1958 (2005 Wadden Sea; failed), successful breeding of European Bee-eater (3 pairs in Zuid-Holland in 2005), 2nd breeding record for Trush Nightingale (nest in 2005 in Flevoland) and first breeding of Greenish Warbler (2003, Island of Schiermonnikoog). Besides, breeding of Black-legged Kittywake at a platform on the Dutch continental shelf, NNW off the Island of Texel (reported since 2000) could be confirmed in 2004. Osprey was observed several times during the breeding season, but nesting could not be confirmed. Earlier increases reported for Little Egret, Great Egret, Eurasian Spoonbill, Barnacle Goose (6000 pairs in 2005), Greater Canada Goose, Red-crested Pochard, Peregrine Falcon, Greater Black-backed Gull, Eurasian Eagle Owl and European Nightjar continued in 2003-2005, partly also co-inciding with an extension in breeding range. Also Middle Spotted Woodpecker expanded its breeding range outside the stronghold in the extreme south of Limburg. Especially Great Bittern, Common Kingfisher and Grey Wagtail benefited from the lack of severe winters since 1997/98 and boomed in 2003-2005. Contary to increases in these species, a number of habitat specialists declined sharply and partly balance on the verge of extinction. These include Eurasian Wryneck, Crested Lark, Tawny Pipit (no breeding pairs in 2003-05), Great Grey Shrike (no breeding pairs), Ortolan Bunting (virtually extinct) and Corn Bunting. Hen Harrier and Short-eared Owl currently experience declines that might well bring them on the verge of extinction in near future. Both species have contracted their breeding range to a few islands in the Wadden Sea and have become vulnerable. Also Northern Wheatear has suffered major losses and has deserted many breeding sites in the coastal dunes in Zuid-Holland and interior parts of the country. Specific research in 2005 showed that a large number of breeding pairs (in 2005 48% of 199 pairs monitored) failed to reproduce. Earlier declines reported for Ruff, Black-headed Gull, Arctic Tern, Whinchat, Great Reed Warbler, PendulineTit and Common Rosefinch continued after 2003. In Eurasian PendulineTit and Common Rosefinch, this trend represents a retreat from an expansion observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Recently, also population size of Pied Avocet along the Wadden Sea coast (mainly northern coast of Groningen and Dollard) has gone down. In a number of colonial breeding birds a tendency for more but smaller colonies has been observed. This trend has been recorded in Great Cormorant, Grey Heron and Rook. In Great Cormorant, this tendency was enhanced by the creation of large artificial islands in Lake IJsselmeer. These islands also attracted Great Ringed Plover, Common Tern (one island with 3700 breeding pairs representing the largest colony in the country), Mediterranean Gull and occasional breeders of Kentish Plover and Little Tern.";0.597;Boele A., Van Dijk A., Hustings F., Van Bruggen J., Koffijberg K., Vergeer J.-W., Plate C.;"SOVON Vogelonderzoek, Postbus 6521, 6503 GA Nijmegen, Netherlands; Centraal Bureau Voor De Statistiek, Postbus 24500, 2490 HA Den Haag, Netherlands";Rare and colonial breeding birds in the Netherlands in 2008-2009 [Kolonievogels en zeldzame broedvogels in Nederland in 2008 en 2009];"This paper reports on rare and colonial breeding birds in The Netherlands in 2008 and 2009.

Fieldwork is mainly conducted by dedicated volunteers and local nature conservation agencies. Counts in the Wadden Sea are also done within the framework of the Trilateral Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP). The breeding seasons of 2008 and 2009 followed rather mild winters, although a short but heavy cold spell in December 2008/January 2009, mainly confined to the SE part of the country, constituted the first severe winter weather since 12 years. Also important for breeding birds, especially those relying on damp meadows, were prolonged dry periods in April (both years) and May-June (in 2008). In both years, July was extremely wet. Highlights in 2008-09 included records of breeding Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo of the race carbo (up to 4-5 pairs in 2009, partly mixed pairs). Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca (2 in 2009, first successful pairs since 1989), Red Kite Milvus milvus (2008 Groningen, first since 1988), Black Kite Milvus migrans (2009 Limburg, successful breeding pair ever). Boreal Owl Aegolius funereus (2 and 5 in Drenthe in 2008-09, accidental breeders perhaps undetected In previous years), European Bee-eater Merops apiaster (Drenthe 2008,4' year in succession, no records in 2009) and Melodious Warbler Hippolais polyglotta (mainly Limburg, 6 in both 2008 and 2009 including mixed pair). Previous newcomers like Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus (Drenthe in 2008-09, not successful). Whitetailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla (in both years in Oostvaarderplassen). Common Crane Grusgrus (Drenthe, 3 pairs in 2008 as well as 2009) still remain at a low level, but are expected to expand in future years.

R.";Environmental constraints have led to the development of an invert mud system which has excellent toxicity, health and safety aspects, and is biodegradable. This system is particularly suitable for North Sea use where discharges from drilling with mineral oil-base drilling fluids are limited. Based on a synthetic material as the continuous phase, this mud system gives the same high performance as that of mineral oil-base systems. This paper describes this novel mud system and focuses on the impact of its use in environmentally sensitive areas. The ratio of synthetic liquid continuous phase and aqueous phase (S/W ratio) can vary from 90/10 to 50/50 with mud weights ranging from unweighted to 18.0 ppg. The rheology parameters can be altered with rheology modifiers to give increased low-shear-rate viscosities for enhanced hole cleaning capabilities. Huxley-Bertram HTHP viscometer data shows good stability of the system under downhole conditions. Additional work indicates this system has reduced gas solubility, better lubricity, and lower retention on cuttings when compared to mineral oil-base muds. Favorable toxicity data, bioaccumulation studies, and biodegradation work have been compiled for both the synthetic material and mud system. U.K. toxicity tests give highly acceptable values. These results, along with the bioaccumulation data, have led the U.K. Department of Energy (DEn) to assign the system a Category 0 classification under its Chemical Notification Scheme. Likewise, the Norwegian government agency (SFT) has agreed to permit this system to be used on a field trial basis. Currently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering its use, and subsequent discharge of cuttings, for Gulf of Mexico drilling.;0.021;Franzaring J., Grass H., Diehlmann A., Fangmeier A.;"University of Hohenheim, Institute for Landscape and Plant Ecology, Stuttgart, Germany; Solvay Fluor GmbH, Bad Wimpfen, Germany";Environmental monitoring of hydrogen fluoride using passive samplers;Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is one of the most phytotoxic air pollutants and even concentrations below 10 ppb may cause visible injury in sensitive plant species. Due to the uptake of atmospheric fluorides by the vegetation and the accumulation of fluorine in the food chain, environmental monitoring in the vicinity of large emitters has often been performed relying on plants as bioindicators only. However, there are currently no approved devices available to determine atmospheric levels of HF in the lower concentration range. In this paper results from a study are presented in which passive samplers were applied for more than one year to monitor ambient levels of HF at various locations around a large chemical factory. Generally, mean HF-levels were only slightly above the limit of detection and remained well below the environmental threshold level for this air pollutant. Although the results from the passive sampler study well represented the spatial dispersion pattern of HF, high standard deviations were observed between the three replicates. Reasons for the high variability were presumably the hygroscopicity of the adsorber material triethanolamine (TEA) and the water films which formed on diffusive bodies at moist weather leading to the wash-off of adsorbed fluorides. In conclusion, advanced methods for passive sampling of HF with less hydroscopic adsorbents and high sampling rates will have to be elaborated for the reliable monitoring of gaseous fluorides.;2008;Article;Gefahrstoffe Reinhaltung der Luft;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57749107480&partnerID=40&md5=bc8ee052f1cb575fe4bb0b0c0d31edf4;Scopus;csv;5952;0.7692577030812324;7459;True;#NV

The sulphuric acid (10% H2SO4) present in the wastes causes in seawater a severe increase in the H+ion concentration (decrease of the pH-value) and in the CO2 partial pressure. These changes are only temporary, because the wastes quickly dilute in seawater and because CO2 is given off into the atmosphere. During the years 1967 to 1974, the horizontal as well as the vertical distribution of pH-value in the German Bight were systematically investigated. The measurement of the horizontal distribution was carried out at 5 m depth, because the strongest pH changes occur in the near-surface water layer, that is, not only because of the wastes but also as a result of photosynthesis and respiration. The pH-values in the German Bight were really different at various seasons of the year. In autumn (including late summer) and early spring relatively low pH-values were found, because at these times of the year the organic compounds which had been built up by primary production (=photosynthesis) during the spring and summer are decomposed again setting free CO2. The lowest pH-values, apart from the titanium dumping area, were found in the vicinity of the Schleswig-Holstein coast; because it is there that the organic matter is decomposed which reaches the German Bight via the rivers Elbe and Weser. The vertical pH differences were low. In spring and summer higher pH-values occurred within the euphotic layer (down to about 15 m depth) than in autumn, because owing to the strong primary production of the phytoplankton much CO2 is taken up from the seawater and converted into organic compounds. The highest pH-values were found in May and June. They were about 8.50. Such high pH-values can only appear in areas with a plentiful supply of nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, etc.) after a period of relatively quiet sunny weather conditions. The patchiness of phytoplankton distribution produces a corresponding microstructure of the pH distribution in the euphotic layer. Below the euphotic layer, the pH-value compared with the cold time of the year was only slightly raised. The fresh screw-water of the wastes tanker showed, in comparison to the surrounding waters, a noticeably lower pH-value. At the centre of the screw-water the pH-value was 7.77 about 1 h after the dumping (5 to 10 m depth). About 2.3 h after the dumping the pH-value was again 8.04, and about 4.7 h after dumping had risen to 8.15. The pH-value of the surrounding seawater lay between 8.22 and 8.32. With lower turbulence, i.e. calm sea, the dilution may take place more slowly; with strong turbulence more quickly. In the titanium dumping area as well as within its near vicinity, flecks with clearly diminished pH-values were found on several occasions. Very probably, these originate from the acid titanium wastes. However, the pH-values observed in the ""acid flecks"", apart from the fresh (visible) titanium tanker screw-water, correspond to those which ""naturally"" occur in the South-East German Bight. In certain cases, the pH differences which naturally occurred were so large that the influence of the acid wastes was not to be recognised. A steady increase in the acid concentration (reduction of pH-value) during the course of the years 1969 to 1974 could not be observed. Evidently, the acids are transported out of the German Bight into the open North Sea by residual currents. Moreover, the acid wastes dumped are neutralised by the CO2 system of the seawater, which releases CO2 into the atmosphere. © 1975 Deutsches Hydrographisches Institut.";0.322;Golombek P., Neugebohrn L.;#NV;( Experimental investigations about the effects of crude oil and dispersed crude oil in tidal flat environments.

The measurements have been performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry: Flame AAS was used as investigating procedure for the determination of Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn. A non-flame atomization system with a heated graphite tube was used for the determination of Cd, Pb, Co, and Ni. The concentration of total Hg was estimated according to the so-called ""cold vapour atomic absorption method"".

The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of current coastal zone management, coastal defense, coastal development, and coastal pollution control policies and activities in the Netherlands. These activities will determine how the Dutch coastal zone is to be managed at the end of the twentieth century, and perhaps provide guidance to others on coastal zone management and utilization.

Ecological concerns, pollution problems and similar considerations have made modern systems approaches necessary. This paper will overview a number of these systems.

Since 1991, 44 species have locally been found attached for the first time, an increase of more than 20 % in the known species number. Of these, 12 are regarded as exotics, the remainder being autochthonous European Atlantic species. The percentage of exotic introductions thus appears to be (much) higher than in most parts of the western European coast, and they account for most of the observed steeper increase in species richness since 1983. An analysis of local patterns of distribution of all additions shows that: 1. Exotics are regularly fast-spreading organisms, soon after their introduction they are found in several localities, whereas the introduced 'European' species more often remain restricted to a small area, or are spreading more slowly. Exceptions to this pattem may indicate 'cryptic' introductions - species closely related to autochthonous European taxa, but with [slightly] different genotypes and different environmental/physiological requirements. 2. Exotic introductions are so far restricted to the subtidal zone and sublittoral fringe of rather sheltered localities; 'new' autochthonous European species occupy in part higher levels in the tidal zone and on average they occur in more exposed localities. 3. Exotics, after their introduction, are found more consistently through the years than their autochthonous counterparts. This confirms the idea that the southern North Sea may not be a suitable habitat for many European Atlantic (stenothermic) seaweeds.";0.8340000000000001;Topfer K.;#NV;Report of the Federal Government to the German Federal Parliament on preparations for the second international conference on the protection of the North Sea [Bericht der Bundesregierung an dem Deutschen Bundestag zur Vorbereitung der 2.

However, different groups of plant taxa may have different relevance depending on their naturalisation and threat status. In this study we investigate the spatial distribution of plant species richness centres in the area of the federal states of Lower Saxony and Bremen, based on data from the plant survey of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsisches Pflanzenarten-Erfassungsprogramm). Our analyses include: 1.) The complete floristic list (1819 taxa) 2.) Three groups of taxa defined by their naturalisation status (1509 indigenous taxa, 160 archaeophytes, 145 established neophytes), 3.) Two groups of taxa defined by their threat situation (unthreatened versus threatened taxa, including 643 taxa which have been Red Listed with status 1, 2, 3, G or R). Based on the complete floristic list, a clumped distribution pattern was observed. Site conditions in the Quaternary coastal and lowland areas are relatively homogeneous and, with exception of the major stream valleys of the Weser, Aller, and Elbe, relatively species-poor. The upland area with its heterogeneous site conditions shows the overall highest taxonomic richness. The large group of indigenous taxa shows a distribution very similar to that of the complete floristic list. Archaeophytes are concentrated in the coastal area of Bremen, the Weser and Aller plains, the old moraine loess landscapes, and in smaller cities. High diversity of established neophytes is mainly found in congested urban areas and several other small-scale centres of diversity. Red List species are mainly indigenous (91 %), 8 % are archaeophytes and only 1 % are neophytes. Their diversity centres are spatially highly differentiated: at the coast only the islands in the North Sea are small hotspots, while in the lowlands relatively large hotspots are situated in the Wendland, the Luneburg Heath, and the Elbe-Weser triangle north of Bremen. In the uplands, the area around Göttingen, the uplands of the Weser and Leine valleys, and the Harz mountain margins are well-defined hotspots of Red List taxa. Many of these endangered species are presumably specialists adapted and limited to natural and semi-natural habitats.;0.982;Aumüller R., Boos K., Freienstein S., Hill K., Hill R.;Avitec Research GbR, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Germany;Do migrating birds avoid offshore wind turbines?

It outlines the effects on birds and harbour porpoises and presents the state of knowledge concerning impacts of wind farms. Harbour porpoises are occuring in high densities west of Sylt and north of Borkum. Except one there are no wind farms planned. During the establishment of the wind mill foundations harbour porpoises are usually dispelled, but these temporary works do not lead to a complete loss of their habitats. More than 100,000 birds regularly use this region as passage migrants. As an impact of wind farms these resting places will be disturbed. But to a limited scale resting birds are able to swerve and find other places, if the area affected is not a highly frequented resting place. The migrating birds use the coastal zone more intensively than offshore areas. Simultaneous mass migration of birds takes place only a few days each year. The birds use different flying heights - lower in the offshorearea than near the coast. Barrier-effects and collisions caused by offshore windfarms must be expected. It is still not possible to predict the number of bird collisions likely to occur at all wind farms proposed. An early warning system, compatible illumination and a concept to switch off the wind mills in times of massive migration could help to avoid bird collision.;0.107;Aumüller R., Boos K., Freienstein S., Hill K., Hill R.;Avitec Research GbR, Sachsenring 11, D-27711 Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Germany;Do migrating birds avoid offshore wind turbines?

Selected bogs were drilled in a grid and samples from the base of these raised bogs have been analysed for the 14C-age. The goal was to date extensive environmental changes. The so far obtained results presented here from the Oldenburgisch-Ostfriesischen Hohenrucken allow a first interpretation. According to the 14C-data a climate change induced by the Holocene marine transgression of the North Sea triggered the formation of raised bogs in Northwest Germany.

T.; Grasmeijer, B.; Van Kessel, T.; Van Maren, D. S.";Wadden Sea ports are situated at the border of the UNESCO World Heritage site Wadden Sea. Because of the protected status of this area, developing new economic activities is not straightforward. However, maintaining and developing port activities is needed to safeguard the economic viability of the Wadden Sea socio-economic region. In this paper we illustrate that sustainable port development is feasible when adopting a Working with Nature approach. This approach facilitates a design in which the proactive utilization and/or provision of ecosystem services serves as part of the engineering solution. We introduce four Working with Nature concepts that can be used in port designs, i.e. 1) optimising dredging strategies, 2) enhancing saltmarsh development, 3) creating estuarine gradients, and 4) optimising flow patterns. Based on these concepts, three case studies have been identified and pilot projects initiated. In the Port of Harlingen a pilot project has started in which an optimized dredging strategy is combined with saltmarsh development. Around the Port of Delfzijl an estuarine gradient is combined with the construction of a salt marsh and dredged sediment is used for dike strengthening. For the Port of Den Helder, a new design is proposed in which the concepts of enhancing salt marsh development, creating estuarine gradients and optimizing flow patterns are combined. Our conclusion is that even in a World Heritage site such as the Wadden Sea, port development is possible when ecosystem services are used and provided for, and when a Working with Nature concept is put at the heart of the design. © Australasian Coasts and Ports 2017 Conference.

Africa Limited, South Africa";Toward zero waste production in the paint industry;Wastewater is generated in the batch production process of water-based paints when vessels and filling lines are washed between batches. This results in a diluted paint wash water stream. The wash water is currently treated in a flocculation process using ferric chloride as a coagulant. An opportunity was identified for re-using wash water from white, non-textured paints. It is necessary to stabilise the wash water with biocides. This water is then used in place of fresh feed water for lower quality paints. Since the wash water originates from high quality products, adding this water to the lower quality paints results in a quality improvement. In addition, treatment costs of the wash water are reduced. This wash water represents approximately 65% of total effluent from the plant. With respect to the remainder of the wash water, the concentration of paint solids in the wastewater stream can vary widely. For effective treatment different solids content in the wastewater requires different dosage levels of the coagulant. If ferric chloride is used as the coagulant overdosing results in waste that must be disposed of as toxic. Ferric chloride dosing can be more easily controlled by using a dilute feed solution. This paper presents the findings of the effect of concentration of the coagulant on the coagulation process. Both the solids content of the wash water and the concentration of the coagulant have been found to be important variables to ensure efficient flocculation and coagulant utilisation.;2004;Article;Water SA;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-11944258496&partnerID=40&md5=28f2ad44c6ccd1a3f1e69a63167bfff8;Scopus;csv;3759;0.7421367521367522;5266;True;#NV

In following these recommendations the Institutfor Fisheries Ecology studies the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in the liver of dab. ERODrepresents one enzyme of the cytochrome P-450 species,also called mixed function oxygenases (MFO), which isinduced by certain organic contaminants, e.g. PCBs. Onthe other hand, an influence of natural factors like season,temperature or spawning on the EROD activity may bepossible. The present study represents an insight into thestatus of the EROD activity in North Sea dab. Ultimately,we intend to decide if EROD activity is an appropriate toolto detect effects of contaminants. The EROD activity in theliver of 687 dabs, caught in the North Sea at different seasons in 1995 and 1996 with the fishery research vessel “Walther Herwig III”, has been determined and the data obtained have been statistically evaluated. The logarithmically transformed values of the EROD activity are following approximately a normal distribution. Due to the wide variation of the enzyme activities and due to the smallnumber of samples minor differences between samples arenot detectable. Nevertheless, comparing the enzymeactivities at different sites of the North Sea, some significant differences have been identified. A model for the discription of seasonal variations of EROD activity, developed at the Biologische Anstalt Helgoland, could be helpful for interpretation.;0.406;[No author name available];#NV;New guidelines for safe trenching decisions;The Trenching Guidelines Joint Industry Project has developed new design guidelines for assessing whether pipelines need to be trenched.

In 1996 and 1997, the largest U.S. natural gas company, Enron Corporation, purchased two wind manufacturing companies and is now developing projects around the world. Japanese trading companies have announced plans to build large wind projects, as have the German power giant Siemens and Florida Power and Light, a major U.S. electric utility. Companies in Denmark and the Netherlands are making plans for even larger offshore wind farms in the North Sea. Continued and perhaps accelerated growth of the wind industry is likely in 1999 and beyond. Spain and the United States are projected to have particularly good years, probably exceeding 500 megawatts of new turbines each. Other countries where growth is likely include Canada, Italy, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The strongest potential developing-country markets include Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey. Ultimately, wind power could be a major force for transforming the global energy economy. In the United States, the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas have sufficient wind capacity to provide all U.S. electricity. In windy regions such as Patagonia, the American Great Plains, or the steppes of Central Asia, wind farms could churn out vast amounts of electricity. A study by Danish researchers in 1998 laid out a strategy for providing 10 percent of the world's electricity from the wind within the next few decades. In the longer run, wind power-both onshore and off-could easily exceed hydropower-which now supplies 20 percent of the world's electricity-as an energy source.;1999;Article;World Watch;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032917270&partnerID=40&md5=b5cba1fbd6e2ff2997906c7ab55cee5a;Scopus;csv;1573;0.640491452991453;3080;True;#NV

Zemed., Brno, Czech Republic;Determination of nitrate content in drainage waters;The most important factor influencing, in certain type of soil and in given application of fertilizers the amount of nitrates washed out of the soil, is the quantity of precipitation which is the primary source of water passing through the sci-drainage system. The quantity of the rate of flow is also markedly influenced by the type of produce. The continuous root system of clover with undergrowth forms an effective barrier against outflow of water and washing of nutrients with higher biological efficiency of the soil. This became manifest when the wash-out of nitrites from one hectare of soil in individual years was compared. In superfluous long-term rains there is a high wash-out of nitrates even if low doses of fertilizers are used. In conditions of superfluous fertilization by nitrogen this tendency becomes even more manifest and the underground and surface waters are polluted with nitrates. The results of analysis of drainage water revealed that the nitrate content, in conditions given by the sampling site, fluctuated in the course of two periods of vegetation from 38.0 to 215.0 mg NO3 -.l-1 in doses of fertilizers from 43 to 80 kg of N per hectare.;1982;Article;Ceskoslovenska Hygiena;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020285835&partnerID=40&md5=57a2426d5190b32449c6c1ff85dd91ac;Scopus;csv;793;0.7241351825282959;2300;True;#NV

Quotas in excess of scientific recommendations, fleet over capacities and poor enforcement of management decisions were identified causal for major stock and yield reductions while gaps in scientific advices were also criticized. The depleted cod stock in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel is the most prominent example. Existing and proposed management regulations were analysed by an expert group which met with fishing industry consultations in Brussels during 28 April – 7 May 2003. Depending on compliance with new technical regulations since 2000, the cod stock and its exploitation was found only marginally effected, while whiting displayed immediately significant losses in yield over long term and short term losses in haddock yields were reversed in substantial gains, also in SSB. However, reduction in fishing effort was found more effective in recovery potential than technical changes including closed areas, for which detailed information about variation in distribution of the stocks and the fisheries are required. Such effort reductions would reduce not only landings but also unregulated discarding, which is believed to be a major reason of the failure of the management measures in mixed fisheries. Recent trends in fishing effort of European fleets could not be quantified due to persistent data deficiencies.;0.002;Symes D.;#NV;UK demersal fisheries and the North Sea: problems in renewable resource management;The North Sea comprises one of the world's most prolific fishing regions but its management has been complicated by the contrasting fishing patterns of its seven coastal states. Industrial fisheries have prospered while food fisheries have declined. Overfishing of the latter has been recognised for over 100 yr and currently stocks of demersal food fish are in a seriously depleted state. As a result, total allowable catches for major demersal species have fluctuated dramatically in recent years. This paper analyses the problems of renewable resource management under conditions of extreme uncertainty. It examines the relationship between the Common Fisheries Policy and the system of devolved quota management adopted by the UK government for its North Sea sector, and concludes that neither system is particularly well adapted to cope with the problems posed by uncertainty. -Author;1991;Article;Geography;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025945196&partnerID=40&md5=2247c53c2af8c67e7f9110a9d622fd5d;Scopus;csv;3048;0.7326179444590145;4555;True;#NV

It refers to the present procedure of determining extreme values of wave-induced responses, including the recent advances of adopting time series of wave elevation as reference design conditions to calculate the wave-induced structural loads on ships in heavy weather. It is shown how this procedure can be extended to account for abnormal or episodic waves. Reference is made to what is presently known about abnormal or freak waves, showing that although it is possible to determine the loads induced by these waves in floating and fixed structures, the present knowledge about the probability of occurrence of these waves is not enough to allow a wave design criterion to be defined in a way consistent with the present probabilistic approaches. However, it is suggested that at the present stage of knowledge it is possible to determine the loads induced by abnormal waves similar to ones that have been measured at various ocean locations and that are thus realistic; a method is described to perform such calculations. Although this information cannot replace the wave-induced loads calculated with the presently established procedures, it can serve as guidance for the design. An application example is presented of a containership subjected to a wave trace that includes an episodic wave that was measured during a severe storm in Central North Sea. The measured wave time history is modified in order to investigate the influence of the wave steepness on the induced vertical motions and loads.

Because, in the terms of the Convention, Rockall is a rock rather than an island, it cannot have its own EEZ. As a result British Fishery Limits have been changed. Neither can Rockall have its own continental shelf which will make it difficult for the UK to maintain its previous claims. the status of Rockall is also of relevance to a legal challenge brought by Greenpeace against the Government's 17th Oil and Gas Licensing Round. The dispute concerned the implementation of European law in offshore waters and, in particular, the UK's failure to implement the EIA Directive in respect of offshore oil and gas installations and the assumption that the Habitats Directive does not apply beyond territorial waters. Although Greenpeace was unsuccessful in its application for judicial review, this last issue remains of relevance.

Two species of bottom-living microalgae, a cyanophyte and a flagellate, tend to form blooms of hitherto unknown intensity, possibly indicating increasing eutrophication of coastal waters. 2) Immigrations. Three invertebrate species and one fish species immigrated into the Wadden Sea and became established. Possibly these species appeared on account of climatic changes. 3) Diseases. In recent years a number of bottom-living invertebrates suffered from diseases, which in some cases have caused increased or even mass mortality. The combined effect of pollutants may weaken certain species and make them less resistant against parasitic infestation. Among parasites, the larval stages of trematodes seem to play a particularly important role in diseases of bivalves. The adult stages live in seabirds as their ultimate hosts. Some of these bird species, eg. herring gull (Larus argentatus) have multiplied enormously. The enlarged bird populations may have given rise to an increased trematode infection of the invertebrate intermediate hosts. -from Author;1981;Article;Environmental problems of the Waddensea-region.

Increased concentration of carbon dioxide is expected to have a rather small effect on saltmarsh vegetation and a negligible effect on the functioning of the Wadden Sea ecosystem. Rates of sealevel rise of 60 and 85 cm per century are not expected to have a major impact on the geomorphology of tidal basins because of increased sedimentation. Also saltmarsh accretion may be able to keep pace with these rates of sealevel rise. Reproduction of several species of bivalve may be impaired by higher winter temperatures and this may affect shorebird populations. -from Authors;1995;Article;Climate change research: evaluation and policy implications.

Whether this increasingly scarce commodity can be exploited to extend the age of fossil fuels depends on the development of offshore production systems. During the summer of 1977, a modular template for a five-well early subsea production system was built in Aberdeen, Scotland. Shell Oil has purchased this system for installation in the North Sea. The system was designed eventually to be tied back and produced to a fixed platform. A different type early subsea production (ESP) system, one using a unitized template, was employed by Petrobras as part of the Garoupa field development in the early part of 1978. Of particular interest is the unique 20-in. pile leveling system, which allows placement of the template onto the ocean floor in a horizontal position. As was the case for the Shell ESP system, these template wells also will be individually tied back to a fixed platform structure. Various ESP systems have been employed and successfully operated in some of the most hostile offshore environments. One, therefore, can argue that the technological and economic viability of ESP systems has been proved, although general acceptance by a conventionally conservative industry cannot be claimed yet. The ESP systems, subject of this paper, are specifically designed to render currently marginal fields economically viable and to extend hydrocarbon production into deeper waters. Another application for these systems is to provide cash flow during the early stages of a major field development when permanent production systems are being constructed. © Copyright 1978, Offshore Technology Conference.;1978;Conference Paper;Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059365574&partnerID=40&md5=c7a251e54c3d4536ca9dc1fccb607b7d;Scopus;csv;1005;0.7322636300897171;2512;True;#NV

There is still much work to be done: reductions in the total loads of various pollutants of from 50% to more than 90% must be achieved.

While the shipping of liquids in bulk is still largely dominated by oil, the percentage of chemicals is sharply rising in certain regions of the world, such as the English Channel through which 30 million tonnes were transported a year in 1988, compared to 150 million tonnes a year in 2000 (HASREP, 2005). This increase in maritime traffic induces an increase in the risk of accidents and, consequently, an increased risk of spills of cargo at sea (collision, grounding, etc.). Furthermore, the wide diversification of the chemical nature of products transported, their highly varied physico-chemical properties that generated very different behaviours at sea, their potentially hazardous nature both for humans and for the ecosystem as a whole, constitute a set of factors that significantly complicate the operational response strategy to be defined in the case of a spill. So as to better identify the risks which certain chemicals transported by sea may present, the notion of Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS) emerged in Europe in 2000. Depending on the substances concerned, location and characteristics of the incident, response can therefore range from the ""leave alone"" option, as in the case of the Maltese chemical tanker Balu which sank in the Bay of Biscay in 2001, releasing her 8,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, to the deployment of major on-land and at-sea response means, as in the case of the chemical tanker Ievoli Sun which sank in the Channel in 2000, for which response operations included both response at sea (treating the cargo) and monitoring of potential pollution on the shoreline (sampling of coastal waters and air quality measurements). Several international, regional and national authorities, aware of the risk connected with the transport of chemicals by sea, have published operational guides to describe the possible response options. For instance, IMO has published several manuals (IMO, 1987, 1992), REMPEC has done the same for the Mediterranean (REMPEC, 1996, 1999, 2004); we can also mention the Helsinki Baltic Sea Convention manuals (HELCOM, 1991, 2002, 2007), the North Sea Bonn Agreement manuals (Bonn Agreement, 1985, 1994) as well as on a national level in France the Cedre response guides each of which is specifically dedicated to a given chemical. Alongside this information, which ranges from is general (i.e. the case of a guide on response at sea to hazardous substances), or specific (i.e. guides that characterize the behaviour and identify the risks related to a given product), the Standard European Behaviour Classification system or SEBC code determines the short-term behaviour of any chemical as long as its physico-chemical characteristics are known. This tool is of the utmost importance for operational staff in charge of response, as it can be used in an emergency to indicate the main components of the ecosystem that will be affected. However, experience has made clear that this code can be tricky to use as it can be difficult to understand how the environmental factors (wind, sunshine, water and air temperature, etc.) will affect the categorization of the chemicals. Indeed these parameters have a very significant influence on the short-term fate of chemicals in the marine environment, in particular on their evaporation kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the atmosphere), their dissolution kinetics (transfer from the water surface to the water column) and their transport and transformation processes in the aqueous phase.";2010;Conference Paper;Proceedings of the 33rd AMOP Technical Seminar on Environmental Contamination and Response;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955596358&partnerID=40&md5=32950eda51b0e0a4a6455b3f7a48f23e;Scopus;csv;5365;0.7556664203005666;6872;True;#NV

This work studies the development drivers for an offshore grid and the potential benefits it would bring. Based on a scenario of 68 GW of offshore wind power capacity, statistics of aggregated power output of offshore wind farms in the North Sea are analyzed with regard to availability and variability. The different development drivers in the past, today and in the future are explored. Together with the offshore transmission needs and wind power projects as envisioned today, this leads to a conceptual offshore grid design proposal that would respond to the needs of the power market as well as to those of offshore wind energy. While today the main driver for offshore transmission infrastructure is trade, wind power will become the main driver in the future. An interconnected offshore grid would serve to transport large amounts of offshore wind power to shore while at the same time providing transmission capacity for international power trade. An interconnected grid also allows the aggregation of wind power over a large area, significantly reducing the variability of the wind power output and the resulting flexibility needs.;2009;Conference Paper;European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2009, EWEC 2009;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870007767&partnerID=40&md5=2ed44050b316a334939501b810d542d7;Scopus;csv;5599;0.694807341146014;7106;True;#NV

Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions created across every segment of the hydrocarbon extraction and production value chain is an essential step in this process. It's already widely acknowledged by operators on the UK Continental Shelf that drill cuttings treatment at the well site can materially reduce costs and improve safety by avoiding the need to collect, contain and transfer cuttings by sea and road freight to a specialist processing facility onshore, as required using the traditional ""skip and ship"" method. It's also widely accepted that by reducing the transport and logistics involved in skip and ship processing, carbon emissions are also greatly reduced, but by exactly how much had not been precisely quantified. In order to support operators' understanding of their carbon footprints towards drilling waste management specifically, TWMA performed a study to establish the comparative carbon footprint for a portable thermal processing drill cuttings processing unit, treating drill cuttings on a standard offshore platform, versus that of a typical skip and ship to shore operation. The study investigated the carbon footprinting process, interpreted recognised guidance and set system boundaries and emission scopes. The carbon footprint associated with each method of treatment was then calculated, based on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per tonne of drill cuttings functional unit. Furthermore, a carbon calculator was created to establish a carbon footprint comparison capability for any well within the North Sea. The results revealed that the carbon footprint of the current skip and ship operation is 53% higher than that of a portable unit treating drill cuttings at typical North Sea well site. Furthermore, and based on the lower estimate of drill cuttings produced on the UK Continental Shelf, additional benefits will include: the diversion of 28,000 tonnes of waste powder from landfill; the recovery of 6000 m3 of produced oil for reuse in the offshore drilling system; and 6000 m3 of water that requires no further wastewater treatment. This study is the first of its kind to show a direct CO2 comparison between offshore processing and the skip and ship cuttings disposal method. It has increased the awareness of the CO2e emissions associated with each process. As the industry moves towards a lower carbon future, it provides a solution to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of drilling operations whilst also improving safety and reducing well cost. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers";2020;Conference Paper;Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097550218&partnerID=40&md5=12cfe71ebef25d34fce69e8bb85ef5f0;Scopus;csv;8731;0.7295757273610471;10238;True;#NV

This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.;#NV;Raupach M., Wolff L.;Institute for Building Materials Research, Aachen University, Germany;Long-term durability of surface protection systems over concrete;The institute for Building Materials Research of Aachen University, performed a comparative testing to determine the long-term durability of selected classes of surface protection systems. These surface protection systems were artificially weathered in different climatic test chambers and also naturally weathered over five years in the village of Westerland on the North Sea island of Sylt and at the city of Duisburg in the industrial area of the river Ruhr. The main methods of verifying the durability of surface protection systems for concrete measure adhesion strength, humidity, chloride content, carbon dioxide level, and crack-bridging properties. Most systems showed decreasing maximum crack-bridging ability after some years of weathering. It was found that influences like intensity of rainfall, humidity, or UV-radiation must be taken into account because these can lead to increasing or decreasing adhesion strength or change in elasticity.;2004;Article;Journal of Protective Coatings and Linings;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33645327258&partnerID=40&md5=31e9fcd25b45cae4766eebeee7fd6bb3;Scopus;csv;3865;0.7407407407407408;5372;True;#NV

Survey of Denmark/Greenland, Øster Voldgade 10, Copenhagen K DK-1350, Denmark;Late Quaternary environmental changes recorded in the Danish marine molluscan faunas;Late Quaternary, marine deposits in Denmark have yielded 247 subfossil species of molluscs. The sites are presented, and comparisons are made between the subfossil mollusc assemblages and the 278 shell-bearing mollusc species presently living in the Danish seas. 184 species are common to the two groups. The 63 species no longer occurring around Denmark are used as indicators of changing environmental conditions, including temperature, salinity and depth, throughout the last 130 000 years. Seven modern faunal regional units are defined and considered: the Bælt, the Baltic, the Kattegat, the Limfjord, the North Sea and the Vendsyssel regions, and the Skagen area based on the Skagen III Well DGU File No. 1.287. The Late Quaternary, marine, shell-bearing molluscs, comprising 341 subfossil and recent species, are characterised from the point of view of climatic (i.e. Arctic, Subarctic, Boreal and Lusitanian) affinities and animal-sediment relationships. On this background the faunal and environmental evolution recorded in the 217 m long Skagen Well core is analysed and described. The mollusc assemblages in the Skagen sequence indicate a deeper-water facies during the Eemian, the Weichselian and the older Holocene in contrast to what hitherto was known in other parts of the Danish area during the Late Quaternary. For the Skagen Well the chronozones Preboreal/Boreal, Atlantic, Subboreal and Subatlantic can be identified by 14C dating. The environmental changes within the seven regions through the Late Quaternary are evaluated by depicting the molluscan communities encountered in the seven Late Quaternary stages together with remarks on studies of the neighbouring areas. By following the marine communities through the Late Quaternary in the light of the classical bottom communities sensu C.G.J. Petersen, it is demonstrated how facies have changed both through time and space within the Danish marine realm. The well-established, more temperate Eemian marine fauna was closely associated with shallow-water environments. The inferred climatic changes reflect an interglacial-glacial cycle. However, the climatically induced changes during the Holocene in the marine environment were small and overshadowed by the facies changes. Out of the 341 species recorded in this study, 140 occur in the Eemian, 36 in the Early/Middle Weichselian and 41 in the Late Weichselian. The Holocene fauna is represented by 183 species of shell-bearing molluscs, of which the first recorded occurrence of 148 species has been radiocarbon-dated.;2004;Article;Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4043118183&partnerID=40&md5=070fed9041ff9d454506438793a4b19d;Scopus;csv;3934;0.7221700083542189;5441;True;#NV

The first section provides an introductory framework to the three main themes, namely resources, environment and development. Section 2 is primarily concerned with the economic and social consequences of oil related development at the national and local level. Section 3 deals with impacts upon the physical environment and introduces the statutory land use planning system in Scotland. Section 4 examines specific field developments, and reviews the statutory controls and international initiatives regulating the extent of environmental disturbance and pollution from offshore operations. Section 5 deals with the role and value of hazard and risk analysis in the siting, layout and safety zoning of onshore facilities and develops a case study on a major fractionation facility. The means of mitigating acute and chronic environmental risks are considered.

The Great War apparently passed rather unnoticed, which explains why there is - generally speaking - no culture of remembrance of this war. But the fishermen in the villages on the North Sea shores (Katwijk, Scheveningen and Egmond aan Zee) had to deal with heavy losses, caused by the British sea mines. The losses were so immense that immediately after the war a cult of remembrance started and the communities erected special monuments in grief. The peculiarity of the war monument in Egmond aan Zee is that it is the most impressive, but the least known. The Fishermen's Monument has the distinctive religious features found in many other European World War I monuments. The monument in the form of a cross with three praying females: grief countered by a vague sense of religious hope. During and after the Second World War little attention was paid to these First World War monuments because there were far more victims in the North Sea during the Second World War. Some World War I monuments were transformed into World War II ones. But since the last decade of the 20th century things have changed. The old fishermen's monuments have known a remarkable revival and have become part of a new cult of remembrance. Fishermen of all ages and all wars who never came back have been brought into focus. It is worth mentioning that this new trend got its momentum in a time that Egmond transformed itself from a traditional fishing community into a touristic attraction, i.e. fishermen folklore gave a new meaning to the old World War I monuments in the Netherlands.;2014;Review;Volkskunde;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901431075&partnerID=40&md5=4e8dc4003d18806751bfa410b7d03a20;Scopus;csv;7958;0.716646789902604;9465;True;#NV

The combined results of aerial surveys, strandings monitoring and tests with passive acoustic monitoring reveal a seasonal pattern, with harbour porpoises being abundant from February to April, and more scarce from May to January.

Surveys were conducted at 32 beach segments ranging from southern San Mateo County to southern Sonoma County. Beached birds were most commonly found in August and September, and most birds at this time were local nesting marine species. During the 1997/98 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, the annual encounter rate for all beached birds more than doubled, and the encounter rate for oiled birds increased more than six-fold. Also during the 1997/98 ENSO the encounter rate for tarballs (hardened patties of oil) was more than twenty times that observed for the preceding year. Periodic increases of oiled birds and tarballs may have reflected the corresponding releases of heavy fuel oil from long submerged vessels, such as the SS Jacob Luckenbach, as well as illegal discharges from merchant and tank vessels. The percentage of beached birds found oiled was lower than that reported in the southern North Sea (1977-1997) and in Newfoundland (1984-1999). Comparison with an earlier beached bird dataset from central California from 1971 to 1981 (Stenzel et al. 1988) suggests that oiling rates have declined since that decade.

Oil pollution and seabirds;"In many parts of the world oil deposits close to the earth's surface seep out. This natural input (0.25 million tons/year) is only a minor part of the total amount of oil entering the world seas (2.5 million tons/year) every year. Transport operations (including tanker- and non tanker accidents, cleaning of cargo compartments, deballasting of fuel tanks and bilge water and dry dock operations: 0.56 million tons/year), fixed installations (0.18 million tons/year), municipal and industrial waste (0.90 million tons/year), urban and river run-off (0.16 m tons/year) and atmospheric fall-out (0.30 million tons/year) are the other main sources of oil input. Although tanker accidents are the most spectacular way of oil input, the large majority of oils in the North Sea originates from ""operational"" (but illegal) discharges of mainly fuel oils from ships. Crude oil (petroleum) consists mainly of hydrocarbons, sulfur and smaller amounts of fatty acids, nitrogen compounds, vanadium and nickel. The number and position of the molecules in the hydrocarbons of crude oil and its refining products, determine the characteristics in terms of biodegradability, state, volatility, toxicity,.... Water-soluble components of crude oil and refined products include a variety of compounds that are toxic to a wide spectrum of marine plants and animals. Weathered oil on a beach causes great damage through its physical properties. Birds are directly affected since oil causes the fine structure of the feathers to clog, resulting in loss of thermal insulation, and water absorption (leading to hypothermia, illness, drowning). By preening their plumage they also ingest oil, causing all kind of pathological effects. Oil is the major cause of death of most seabird species in the North Sea and Channel. Evidence for specific oiling incidents and for the level of chronic oil pollution can be obtained from beached bird surveys. This method is complementary to aerial surveys and a rather cheap way to monitor vast areas. The percentage of birds that are oil contaminated (oil-rate) is an integrated and useful measure to determine the oil pollution. These oil-rates are particularly high in diving seabirds and species spending most of their lifespan at sea. Although some local examples of declining oil-rates have demonstrated the effect of policy measures, the overall North Sea oil-rates do not seem to have declined substantially the last few decades. The 1000-6000 seabirds washing ashore each year on the Belgian coast, have oil-rates of over 50%.";1997;Article;Bulletin de la Societe Royale des Sciences de Liege;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-5644241736&partnerID=40&md5=6461da46734f02f63efe28527c604290;Scopus;csv;1902;0.8629531388152077;3409;True;#NV

To assess the recent stage of the different habitats and to monitor their changes in the near future standard mapping and quality tools are requested. To map the sub-tidal part of the Wadden Sea area optical approaches are mostly less successful. To develop standard procedures for sub-aquatic monitoring, three hydroacoustic devices were tested their resolution, their redundancy and their value of benefit detecting habitats. In order to find out which are the system-specific limitation, foot-print sizes and coverage in different water depth we surveyed several test areas in water depth of 5 to 15 m simultaneously with singlebeam echosounder (200 kHz), multibeam echosounder (455 kHz) and sidescan sonar (380 kHz). Two surveys (in 2007 and 2008) are described here. By means of acoustic seabed classification tools the different characteristics of seafloor roughness were analysed. Four major acoustic classes were distinguished which cover sea surface sediments of sand, broken shells, gravel, less mud and infrequently some peat. All acoustic devices show similar complex spatial pattern with higher variability in 2007. Class 1 and Class 3 are the most redundant classes which are characterized by medium sand and varying amounts of gravel and shell fragments. Stronger differences in the acoustic classes were observed in the singlebeam which is stronger influenced by its lower frequency. The feedback of footprint and sediment matrix is not sufficiently explained nowadays.;2011;Conference Paper;Journal of Coastal Research;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857420725&partnerID=40&md5=d0b7828ac05efa318ea80ff62c2b2979;Scopus;csv;4968;0.7403030303030302;6475;True;#NV

This article describes the results of aerial surveys to assess its distribution and density in Belgian waters, in concert with the first results of tests with passive acoustic monitoring devices (Porpoise Detectors - PoDs), and a basic analysis of strandings. The strandings data over four decades clearly demonstrate an increase of harbour porpoises in the BPNS, with only few stranded animals between 1970 and 1997 (0 to 6 per year), increasing numbers between 1998 and 2004 (8 to 40 per year), and even higher numbers between 2005 and 2009 (62 to 94 per year). The combined results of aerial surveys, strandings monitoring and tests with passive acoustic monitoring reveal a seasonal pattern, with harbour porpoises being abundant from February to April, and more scarce from May to January.

The blooms take many forms and have many effects. Sometimes their effects may be lethal, as when drinking water and sea foods become contamined with potent toxins. They can cause extensive economic damage, for example to the stocks of fish farms, and they can be a nuisance to tourism, as when foam accumulates on beaches. Specific examples of harmful algal events include large accumulations of plankton stocks in the Black Sea, the effects of dinoflagellate poisoning on the mortality of benthic animals and fish in the North Sea, serious public health problems in tropical coastal areas caused by a widespread species of dinoflagellate, and the effects of ultraplankton blooms on beaches and fishing nets. Models of population dynamics can contribute to an understanding of the role of factors influencing algal blooms, such as nutrient status and grazing as well as algal variation over space and time and the sequences in species successions. At large spatial scales, there is a strong and direct connection between changes in microplankton communities and climate changes and meteorological events. But at the lcoal level, it is stronlgy suspected that the very industries which are hardest hit by harmful algae, especially aquaculture, are contributing to the problem by practices such as overstocking and overfeeding.;1998;Article;Nature and Resources;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032448707&partnerID=40&md5=4f7f898e07efd66eaaef4b333af1caac;Scopus;csv;1694;0.6539322444041137;3201;True;#NV

The impacts on fisheries are due to a variety of direct and indirect effects of a number of physical and chemical factors, which include temperature, winds, vertical mixing, salinity, oxygen, pH and others. The direct effects act on the physiology, development rates, reproduction, behaviour and survival of individuals and can in some cases be studied experimentally and in controlled conditions. Indirect effects act via ecosystem processes and changes in the production of food or abundance of competitors, predators and pathogens. Recent studies of the effects of climate on primary production are reviewed and the consequences for fisheries production are evaluated through regional examples. Regional examples are also used to show changes in distribution and phenology of plankton and fish, which are attributed to climate. The role of discontinuous and extreme events (regime shifts, exceptional warm periods) is discussed. Changes in fish population processes can be investigated in experiments and by analysis of field data, particularly by assembling comparative data from regional examples. Although our existing knowledge is in many respects incomplete it nevertheless provides an adequate basis for improved management of fisheries and of marine ecosystems and for adapting to climate change. In order to adapt to changing climate, future monitoring and research must be closely linked to responsive, flexible and reflexive management systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Increased concentration of carbon dioxide is expected to have a rather small effect on saltmarsh vegetation and a negligible effect on the functioning of the Wadden Sea ecosystem. Rates of sealevel rise of 60 and 85 cm per century are not expected to have a major impact on the geomorphology of tidal basins because of increased sedimentation. Also saltmarsh accretion may be able to keep pace with these rates of sealevel rise. Reproduction of several species of bivalve may be impaired by higher winter temperatures and this may affect shorebird populations. -from Authors;1995;Article;Climate change research: evaluation and policy implications.

It is joined to the Celtic Sea (and hence the North Atlantic Ocean) in the west, and to the North Sea at its northeastern corner. Maximum depths range from 40 m in the east to 100 m in the west, extending to 160 m in the Hurd Deep. The most important factor influencing the occurrence, abundance and distribution of intertidal and marine plant and animal species is the temperature of the water column and its variation. The sensitivity of species to temperature may be enhanced as the Channel lies at the boundary of two biogeographical provinces, the warm Lusitanean and the colder Boreal. Other important factors for benthic species include bed characteristics and physical disturbance. The coastlines of France and England sustain a wide variety of natural habitats, including cliffs, rocky and sandy shores, shingle, dunes, salt marshes and saline lagoons. There are also a large number of estuaries, with freshwater inflow dominated by the River Seine. Extensive stretches of the coast are rural and support low-intensity arable farming. Interspersed along the coast are urban and industrial centres; the total population of the Channel coast is approximately 8 million, although this can increase significantly during the summer tourist season. The Channel is one of the world's busiest areas for shipping. The region also supports a commercially important fishery (both fish and shellfish) and is a nationally important region for sand and gravel extraction. Human activities on the coastal and marine environment have manifested themselves in a number of ways, including land reclamation, chemical pollution and fishing. These pressures remain palpable, although today a large number of national and transnational protective measures are in place. Indeed, natural factors may exert greater stresses on the coastline in the near future as the combined effects of sea-level rise and increasing storminess become more apparent. Within the last decade there has been a realisation that an important way to protect the coastline in a sustainable manner is for all parties with a stake in the coastal and marine environment to coordinate their activities within an ongoing economic, management and legislative framework. This Integrated Coastal Zone Management is being actively adopted within this region, and is likely to be the key to the long-term protection of the English Channel.";2000;Article;Seas at the millennium - an environmental evaluation - Volume 1;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033674865&partnerID=40&md5=a7250600e1a20cc0cfab0e1136262fea;Scopus;csv;1458;0.7650234182741923;2965;True;#NV

The tendency of people worldwide to live or work near the seaside as well as tourism and industrial developments along the seashore, have exercised pressures on the marine environment. These include chemical pollution, loss of biodiversity, introduction of alien species, ecosystem degradation, loss of marine mammal population and beach erosion. Enrichment of the marine environment with nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, from agricultural activities, marine aquaculture, sewage effluents and airborne pollution, stimulates phytoplankton growth causing a number of problems known as ""eutrophication"". Eutrophication can affect fisheries and marine biodiversity; it can also lead to phytoplankton blooms sometimes with toxic phytoplanktonic species, algal scum, bacterial blooms, fungi developments, hypoxia and in extreme cases anoxia. Among the side effects of eutrophication, reduced transparency or even change of the sea color impairs the recreational value of coastal waters and it is therefore a serious problem that has economic consequences for coastal states. A number of regional treaties have already been enforced including the problem of eutrophication. The Barcelona Convention for the Mediterranean, the Bucharest Convention for the Black Sea, the HELCOM Convention for the Baltic and the OSPAR Convention for the North Sea are among the regional instruments implemented for a better governance of the marine environment. In this chapter the eutrophication status of the European Regional Seas is examined, the policies for mitigating eutrophication are reviewed and the effectiveness of the measures over the period of implementation is assessed. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

They believe that unlike areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, which have established deepwater drilling programs, areas off the coast of Australia, India and China must deal with the complex carbonates that comprise their seabeds to effectively exploit oil and gas. According to them, as geotechnical engineers strive to better understand the makeup of the seafloor, understanding geohazards is crucial. Assessment of risk from seabed slides involves not only estimating the probability of a new slide being generated, but modeling the likely runout path of the resulting debris flow and determining whether or not it will impact subsea infrastructure. Randolph recognizes that the industry is experiencing a downturn. However, he insists that now is an ideal time to develop more economical ways to exploit deepwater fields in challenging environments. Ironically, it also is a time when funds for research are often cut.;2015;Article;Offshore Engineer;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947271719&partnerID=40&md5=20fced23106c6b5cf8ec838c0a2b88e4;Scopus;csv;7311;0.7195365418894831;8818;True;#NV

The proposed measures are the building blocks of three dimensional Gradient of Texture (3D-GoT), which can quantify texture variations in threedimensional space. The proposed dissimilarity measures exploit the strong coherence between neighboring seismic sections and compute cubes dissimilarity by incorporating all inline, crossline and time directions that make it effective as compared to those of 2D dissimilarity measures. The perceptual dissimilarity are consistent with human perception and yield better dissimilarity as compared to non-perceptual measures. The experimental results on the real dataset from the North Sea, F3 block illustrate that the perceptual dissimilarity measures are not only computationally more efficient but also yield better salt dome delineation results as compared to the non-perceptual dissimilarity measures.;2016;Conference Paper;78th EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2016: Efficient Use of Technology - Unlocking Potential;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020208556&partnerID=40&md5=63a71729a5a560ac77110741df048867;Scopus;csv;7235;0.7306721056721056;8742;True;#NV

J.";#NV;#NV;Lomonosov I.S., Antipin V.S., Lomonosova T.K., Gapon A.E.;#NV;Comparison of the composition and geochemical features of bedrocks and solid runoff of big rivers in the Baikal catchment basin;We have studied the relations of the composition of the solid runoff of rivers in the Baikal basin with mineralogy and geochemistry of bedrocks of recognized feeding petrographic provinces - Primor'e, Khamar-Daban, and Barguzin. The latter are made up of ancient volcanoplutonic rocks of subalkalic and calc-alkalic compositions, mainly granitoids, deeply metamorphosed rocks of the Precambrian basement, and Meso-Cenozoic sediments. The basin of the Selenga River, supplying 70% of the runoff of all river drifts, is of particular value. Chemical elements in solid runoff occur in mineral phases and their associations and also migrate in adsorbed state on organic and mineral suspensions and colloids. The major element concentrators are minerals of heavy (0.25-0.05 mm) and fine-pelitic (0.001 mm) fractions. The concentrations of elements in the solid runoff of the rivers are close to their Baikal clarkes, whereas the contents of ore elements (Mn, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Pb, and Sn) are 2-6 times lower than their clarkes in sedimentary rocks, which reflects the general geochemistry of bedrocks in the Baikal catchment basin. The heavy fractions of the solid runoff of rivers in the Primor'e province are dominated by amphiboles, pyroxenes, and minerals of epidote group, i. e., minerals with elevated contents of Ag, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Mo, whereas in the solid runoff of the Barguzin province the contents of these elements are minimum. The Khamar-Daban province abounds in ilmenite-magnetite, amphibole-pyroxene-epidote, and magnetite-ilmenite-garnet-epidote associations, and the Barguzin province, in sphene-ilmenite association with rutile, titanoniobate, corundum, and other minerals. Such elements as Ce, Th, Y, Se, etc. have been found in the heavy fraction of the solid runoff of rivers in the Khamar-Daban province and are absent from the Primor'e province. The mineral and elemental compositions of the solid runoff of the Selenga River are governed by the wash-out from its vast water catchment area composed of compositionally different rocks. The runoff has elevated contents of Sr, B, and Zn and reduced contents of Mn. The specific features of the mineral composition and geochemistry of the solid runoff of rivers in the Baikal catchment basin determined the composition of modern bottom sediments, which allows reconstruction of their geologic history in the Holocene and prediction of the behavior of sedimentation during climatic changes.;2001;Article;Geologiya i Geofizika;#NV;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26044480876&partnerID=40&md5=63e7ed9db7aa04524899970396aad5fa;Scopus;csv;4412;0.7939148612520995;5919;True;#NV
